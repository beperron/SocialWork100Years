KP- techniques of W. H. Masters & V. E. Johnson
KP- treatment of sexual dysfunctions in social casework relationship
SU- Sexual Function Disturbances; Social Casework
AB- Suggests and explores the usefulness of the techniques developed by W. H. Masters and V. E. Johnson for the treatment of sexual dysfunctions within a social casework relationship. The successful use of this approach in a psychology clinic in Seattle, Washington, is described. Its effectiveness seems to be due to 3 factors: (a) Dual-sex teams of therapists are more successful than individual therapists. (b) If the therapy team functions well, it plays a catalytic role in marital communication by encouraging verbal exchange between patients and thus helping them to increasingly understand each other's sexual needs. (c) The premise that attitudes and ignorance rather than psychopathology or physical illness are responsible for most sexual problems is basic to this approach.

Characterized by apathy, lack of initiative, loss of interest in things and events, submissiveness, and deterioration of personal habits and standards, the disease develops and exists independently of the syndrome for which the patient was hospitalized. It is caused by lack of contact with relatives, friends and the outside world, enforced idleness, and a depressing atmosphere. Treatment and prevention consist of improving hospital conditions and policies to allow for outside contact, in-hospital rehabilitative employment, maintenance of family relationships, and a cheerful, attractive environment. It is suggested that an aftercare program for dismissed patients should be provided. (23 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

Differences between case work and psychotherapy are the level of consciousness addressed, the nature of techniques employed, the types of problems dealt with, and the ultimate objectives. It is concluded that case work consists of supportive and reeducative psychotherapy, plus social services in terms of concrete assistance.

AB- Investigated the marital relationships of 25 hysteria and anxiety state neurotics undergoing treatment in hospitals under qualified psychiatrists. Ss were matched with 25 normal persons with similar backgrounds. A structured questionnaire was used. Results indicate that about twice as many neurotic Ss as normal Ss experienced incompatibility in temperament, nonmaterial expectations from the spouse, the impression that demands remain unfulfilled, and maladjustment in sexual relations. Almost all factors support the hypothesis that married neurotic women have more strained marital relations than do normal women. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

Findings show that even among educated persons, faith healing and cruel physical treatment remain common; few are well informed about methods of scientific treatment; most cannot recognize mental illnesses until they are in advanced stages; and many are still unaware of the psychiatric implications of alcoholism, homosexuality, and crime.

Both situations are illustrated by clinical case examples. If the clinician presents himself as a benevolent figure and allies himself with the client's ideals and aspirations, then negative expectations should be offset.

KP- client race & social class & extent of pathology

SU- Psychodiagnosis; Racial and Ethnic Differences; Social Workers; Socioeconomic Status
AB- 360 professional social workers employed by the State of California received mailed questionnaires with written case histories which randomly varied in terms of client race, social class, and extent of pathology. Subjects were asked to complete a Treatment Decision Inventory (TDI) containing 24 items intended to represent diagnostic, treatment, and attitudinal judgments. 5 factors emerged from factor analysis of the 360 returned TDIs: Factor A, "Assessment"; Factor B, "Suitability for Treatment"; Factor C, "Social Emphasis in Treatment"; Factor D, "Tenor of Relationship"; and Factor E, "Attitude." Analysis of variance, carried out on each of the 5 factors, indicate clearly that race, social class, and degree of pathology affected clinical judgments. Black clients were judged more positively than white clients. Lower-class clients were viewed more negatively than upper-class clients, and the more "pathological" case was judged less favorably. Treatment implications are considered in some depth. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

KP- objectivity & deterministic thinking vs subjectivity & self-concept
KP- understanding in social work
SU- Client Characteristics; Life Experiences; Self Concept; Social Casework
AB- Considers that much social work has been undertaken on the basis of common sense, intuition, and the feeling that the client's situation has been "understood." Medical sociological, and psychological sources of theories which posit "objectivity" and deterministic ways of thinking are criticized as contrary to true understanding and not supportive of constructive attitude and professional change. It is suggested that the goal of social work should be to discipline this "understanding" based on an investigation of the meaning which people give to their world and their role in that world. This phenomenological approach emphasizes subjectivity and the role of the self-concept. It incorporates the formative influences of past experiences while asserting the primacy of the person who imposes significance on those events and his present situation. It is believed that such an approach would relate more directly to the practice and goal of social work and those concerned with social welfare.

The work of the Samaritans, an English volunteer suicide and crisis prevention organization, is described. Results of surveys of the Samaritans and their clients indicate that they have been successful in reducing suicide rates to a small but significant degree. Findings from American suicide prevention services are briefly presented and difficulties in interpreting these data are discussed. Reasons for the increase in suicide attempts in Britain are examined (e.g., the relaxation of moral norms opposing suicide and increases in anomie). It is suggested that psychological, sociological, and biological factors are all contributors to the increases in suicide attempt rates and that high-risk populations and the role of prevention efforts should be further studied.

No difference was noticeable when compared on the factors of occupation, income, parental education, and caste. However, more urban youth coming from families of unskilled workers wanted to study further compared with rural youth of similar backgrounds. More urban than rural youth of low caste wanted to study further. The position was reversed in regard to future plans of the youth whose parents were agriculturists. Social-cultural hypotheses are discussed. (58 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Discusses middle age as a stage in life often neglected by mental health researchers and theorists. The problems of therapy with middle-aged mothers and fathers are discussed. Such clients face crises of their own (e.g., menopause and job failure) in addition to those generated by their growing teenagers. Letting go of children, and the nature of their marriage itself, are particularly bothersome at this age. Self-awareness is the primary mode for their resolution. The psychotherapist can foster this by making the destructive interaction between partners ego-alien. A case example is provided. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Discusses the Family-a voluntary client-led and client-operated drug rehabilitation group with 65-90 members (at any one time). This group views the addict as a fixated child in an adult body. Its role is thus to train the member to recognize and relate to real people. Discipline is strict. Theoretically, the Family borrows concepts from transactional analysis, Gestalt therapy, reality therapy, E. Erikson, W. Reich, and Freud. The program is carried out through the symbolic use of a wartime battlefield game. The game teaches that an individual's accumulated rage over real and imagined injustice is both useless and a barrier to emotional growth. The game uses the confrontation of sensitivity groups and the primitive explosion of Gestalt therapy. It is reported to be effective with 85% of the members.

AB- Proposes that neither the sociological nor the psychological approaches based on Durkheim's theories of suicide answer, in themselves, the fundamental question: Why do only some people in a given society commit suicide? Several factors are identified: psychic predispositions of the individual, structural situation of the system (society), strength of the "protective shell" of the individual, and the individual's own perception of the social situation. Taking these factors into account, a new formulation of the theory is given and discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

The approaches differ in their methods of identifying the problem and in the form of the patient-therapist relationship. It is suggested that a child guidance agency whose goal is to meet community needs may experience difficulties with behaviorally oriented therapy because of the noncompliance of parents. Supportive therapy is recommended as an adjuctive treatment to a behavior modification program. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

KP- group therapy interaction chronogram
KP- recording sequential group therapy sessions & demonstrating progressive phases
SU- Group Psychotherapy; Psychotherapeutic Processes
AB- The group therapy interaction chronogram (GTIC), an heuristic device for rapidly recording sequential group therapy sessions, demonstrates the progressive phases within each session and exhibits dynamic patterns in successive sessions. It is of particular value where traditional methods of recording, e.g., the tape-recorder or use of a 1-way screen, are contraindicated. Theoretical and practical difficulties of recording content and interaction patterns are discussed, and the evolution of the GTIC from the author's individual chronogram is described. The GTIC can be used by professional staff from many disciplines to record any group session whether it is formal group psychotherapy, counseling, discussion, or case conference. A hypothetical example of a completed GTIC is given, but it is emphasized that each therapist must choose his own notation depending on the dimensions he wishes to record.

KP- theoretical & practical criteria predictors
KP- success in 2-yr social work course
SU- Academic Achievement Prediction; Social Work Education
AB- Attempted to discover those variables which would most effectively predict success on a 2-yr social work course. 2 intakes of students (n = 40 and 41) beginning professional polytechnic courses were administered a battery of 10 tests. It was hypothesized that (a) the predictors of theoretical and practical criteria would differ and (b) there would be a significant correlation between a reading comprehension test and the theoretical criterion. Results indicate that theoretical performance was effectively predicted by cognitive variables, but only the Nufferno Level Test, measuring ability and persistence, correlated significantly and consistently with the practical criterion. Highly significant correlations were found also between 1st- and 2nd-yr examination results and the practical criterion. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)

Discussion centered around clinical procedures, differences from traditional team approaches, and the implementation of research findings in practice. Results indicate that this intensive individualized approach was successful, especially with aggressive patients. However, gains made during the program dissipated when treatment terminated which reinforces the importance of sustained treatment for patients in this age group.

Findings indicate that the variable most crucial to the adjustment process was that of financial resources, followed by a dependency on family members. Other related variables found were age, sex, socioeconomic background, and severity of the disease. The emergence of a basic defense pattern among patients differing only in degree was identified. Issues requiring further clarification are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

Results from 25 group sessions and interviews with 11 of the regular participants indicate that consciousness-raising sessions provided a new experience and language through which shifts in identity, self-understanding, and world view occurred. In addition, greater autonomy confidence, self-knowledge, and changes in negotiation of interpersonal relationships were reported by the participants. Group membership was instrumental in fostering shifts in member's ideals and values; group processes increased the member's sense of well-being. This group was effective for educationally and economically advantaged women; however, it is unclear as to its utility for other segments of the population.

AB- Examines problem families in which infantilization of women by their mothers coupled with absence of a normal relationship with their fathers has resulted in poor functioning and low self-esteem. The dysfunction of the mother is reinforced by extended family menbers, especially siblings, and carries over into the next generation. Treatment is usually sought for the daughter most like the mother when a crisis occurs, e.g., the death of the grandmother or the separation of the mother from the husband, and this crisis provides impetus for reorganization of the family and development of more capability and autonomy for the mother. The phases of therapy are described, and case material is used to illustrate the process by which the mother is helped to achieve some measure of autonomy.

AB- Discusses factors involved in the effective treatment of an adolescent. It is suggested that the therapist should have a working knowledge of developmental processes, adolescent psychopathology, and the patient's familial and cultural milieu. Factors essential to the development of communication in the therapeutic relationship are explored. It is considered that the therapist should be a sympathetic and empathetic listener and allow the adolescent to unburden emotionally laden material. The therapist's encouragement of the adolescent to discover herself is considered an essential ingredient conducive to psychotherapeutic gain. In the long run, this will facilitate growth and development of new strengths and capacities. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

Of those "running from," 5 ran to a friend's home, 6 verbalized reasons for leaving, 5 never returned to court, and only 1 was committed. Of those "running to," 12 ran to deviant experiences, 11 verbalized reasons for leaving, all 13 returned to court, and 9 were committed. Results indicate that girls running from family conflicts significantly benefited from family therapy, while the behavior of those seeking deviant experiences was not altered by any of the utilized methods of intervention.

Findings show that the patient, when labeled as black, was classified among the schizophrenias or borderline categories by almost all of the respondents, while the same patient, when identified as white, was most often diagnosed as obsessive compulsive. More favorable ratings were assigned to the white protocol to a significant degree (p &lt; .05). Data suggest that the distorting influences of attitudes associated with race have not yet been overcome. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

Of 897 suicides, 58 were students. Age range was 14-23; 57% were male; all but one female was single; about 1/3 were university students, the remainder lower school students. Methods of suicide included (in decreasing order) poisoning, drowning, hanging, and burning. Factors associated with education (tests), economics, illness, and parental conflicts were the main reasons given. 60.3% committed suicide in their homes. 20.7% occurred in March, 15.5% in April and 12% in July. Only 4 males and 4 females left notes. (16 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

It is maintained that this organisonic conception of man is a holistic view which articulates the practioner's image of mankind in relation to his environment and as such can be a framework for practice and education.

AB- Describes a project in which graduate social work students were assigned, as part of their field training, to private family physicians' offices. The importance of the social worker's input to the medical team is stressed. The objectives of the program were to enhance collaborative skills, improve team communication, introduce counseling as part of the physician's practice, reduce necessity for outside referrals, and sensitize team members to each other's roles and areas of expertise. It is concluded that these types of placements can be valuable to social work education, the patients served, and the family practitioner.

KP- placing antisocial & prosocial boys in same group
KP- antisocial behavior & effect on prosocial children
KP- 9-12 yr old boys in summer camp
SU- Antisocial Behavior; Behavior Problems; Peer Relations
AB- Evaluated the effects of placing antisocial and prosocial 9-12 yr old boys in mixed groups in a summer camp. 44 Ss were placed in 4 prosocial (i.e., no antisocial children) groups and 37 prosocial and 5 antisocial Ss were placed in 4 mixed groups. Antisocial behavior was defined as physical or verbal aggression toward others, object aggression, and disruptive behavior toward peers and adults. Antisocial Ss were identified from parent, referral agency, O and self ratings. 2 trained Os rated Ss' behavior during the 3-wk experimental period. Although not significant, results show that (a) there was little incidence of antisocial behavior among prosocial Ss in mixed groups (the highest frequency of antisocial behavior occurred during the 1st wk); and (b) antisocial Ss maintained a relatively constant rate of both pro- and antisocial behavior during the 3 wks. It is concluded that mixing antisocial and prosocial children does not have any significant effects on prosocial children. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Describes "ascription," a technique used in interviews which gives immediate qualitative feedback to the client about his situation. Ascriptive statements given by the interviewer help clients to reflect on themselves and improve communication between counselor and client. Implications of ascription in various social work theories are discussed. A survey of 20 tape-recorded interviews between social work instructors and a family revealed 526 ascriptions; 85% of the ascriptive statements provoked immediate responses from clients. Various kinds of ascriptive statements are considered. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

The benefits of the approach include direct contact and the opportunity for immediate communication among the consultant, consultee, and patient; a comprehensive child evaluation with the consultee participating in the final group interview and treatment plan; a strengthening of the relationship between consultee and family due to a shared learning experience from team discussion; and increased understanding of cases in a comparatively short time period. In follow-up contact, consultees expressed positive reactions in terms of consultee-patient relations, as well as the desire to utilize this method of consultation in future cases.

AB- Used interviews with 534 young married women regarding their family growth, ideals, desires, and expectations in order to test the hypothesis that persons who adhere to traditional ideas will also adhere to traditional ideas about fertility planning and family size. This hypothesis was proven. Age did not influence the effects of traditionalism on fertility. Fertility was somewhat higher in rural than in urban-born women, and was negatively related with income and educational attainments. The traditionalism factor carried more importance than duration of marriage or the differentiation between "housewives" and "employed" women. Thus, the influence on fertility of traditional adherence in general is strong and independent of most factors affecting sterility. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

KP- valid minority research
SU- Experimentation; Minority Groups
AB- Reviews and critically analyzes 3 assumptions supporting the position that valid research in the area of minority concerns can only be executed by minority researchers. These assumptions are that valid minority research requires a researcher who has full membership in a minority culture; that minority affiliation is essential in order that the investigators be free of transcultural biases; and that minority status is necessary for the researcher to be accepted by the minority community. Although it is conceded that past minority research has been poor and needing revision, it is concluded that these assumptions are singularly unpersuasive. The alternative solutions offered are that more stringent controls be placed on the scientific method; that the minority community have further controls on the research; and that non-minority researchers make use of representatives from the minority community to assist in understanding certain phenomena.

AB- When people seek social work help with problems in their relationships with others to whom they are very close and by whom they feel betrayed, attacked, or maltreated, the distress and force with which the problem is brought are often so great that the social worker may accept as substantially accurate the client's view of the situation and act accordingly. It is argued that this line of action may be misguided or even harmful, and that help can only be effective in the situations described if one assumes that the picture conveyed of "the absent 3rd person" has more connection with the client's own inner needs than with anyone else.

AB- Describes a volunteer case aide program started in 1963 in a psychiatric setting to utilize the talents of mature community volunteers to work in a direct personal, 1-to-1 relationship with the mentally ill and/or emotionally disturbed. Through the program, the community has been brought into closer cooperation with the hospital. Volunteers and part-time psychiatric social workers have helped diminish the manpower shortage in the mental health field, relieve the chronicity of many patients, and move patients into community placements. The associate leader training program through its weekly training meetings, gives the experienced volunteer the responsibility of teaching the beginning case aide to understand his own role with the patient, relate effectively with the patient, and learn about the hospital operations, treatment modalities, and pertinent psychiatric and social theories. New volunteer groups under the associate leaders' guidance have proven to be effective instruments for the expanded teaching and service aspects of the case aide program.

AB- Suggests that T groups might be of value in social-work training as a means of encouraging social workers to make greater use of group techniques. T groups have been criticized on ethical grounds and for their tendency to produce psychological disturbance in predisposed individuals. In the context of social-work training, T groups have the dual function of promoting self-awareness in the participants and increasing their knowledge of group dynamics. A procedure is described which emphasizes the necessity of focusing on group behavior, as opposed to individual psychopathology. It is argued that this procedure would reduce the psychological hazards. A brief outline is given of the manner in which material produced in the group sessions may illustrate theoretical material introduced elsewhere in the training course. (15 ref.)

AB- As part of a longitudinal investigation of the development of all children born in Britain in 1 wk of 1958, the characteristics of motherlessness among 237 11-yr-olds living with their natural fathers were examined. Interviews with fathers or other adults show that 1/2 of the cases of motherlessness were caused by marital breakdown and 1/2 by the mother's death. Families in which the mother was missing tended to be smaller than intact families and to contain a higher proportion from lower social class backgrounds. Two-fifths of the children concerned were being cared for by their father alone. One child in 3 had a stepmother, with remarriage being more common among younger fathers. Comparative data from the larger study indicate that children who had lost their mother by the age of 11 were less likely to be living in a 1-parent family than those who had lost their father.

AB- 602 out of a total of 5,000 outreach cases, seen within 1 year, were reviewed to evaluate an outreach project in New York City staffed by indigenous paraprofessionals within a multiservice center framework. The project provided the indigenous worker a chance for greater upward mobility. Unlike the focus of the welfare staff concentrating on eligibility for assistance, these outreach workers concerned themselves with the client's personal crisis, and developing social competence. The overall evaluation was a positive one, establishing the project as an agent for the community. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Describes treatment of a couple and their child who lived in a communal setting catering to runaways. Treatment took place at Clinic of Children's Psychiatric Hospital, University of Michigan Medical Center. The initial presenting problem was sudden incorrigibility of the couple's son. The couple was suspicious of the traditional approach of the Clinic and often intellectualized their family problems. An attempt was made to overcome fear of establishing a therapeutic alliance. During therapy the couple realized the communal relationships were not working, that the commune was a tool to avoid intimacy, and that to achieve independence they would have to move back to their own home. Throughout treatment the couple was dealing with environmental changes, role conflicts in their relationship, internal struggles, and movement towards maturity.

KP- readoption from 1 family to another
KP- emotionally deprived child
SU- Adoption (Child); Case Report; Emotional Disturbances
AB- Readoption became necessary in a case where an emotionally deprived child was placed with a couple unable to cope with the situation. The youngster's natural mother was unwed and had kept the child for 15 mo prior to placing him for adoption. He was catatonic, passive, and moody, placing a strain on the adoptive parents and their children. Therefore it became necessary to change the placement; however, transition was gradual. Preliminary meetings among the 2 families and the child paved the way for eventual success. The original placement was not viewed as a failure but rather an opportunity to ease the guilt of the original adoptive parents and make a smooth adjustment for the adopted child into his new home.

SU- Attitude Change; Culture Change; Parent Child Relations; Social Values
AB- 3 culturally related changes in adult attitudes toward children and youth were explored. Achievement orientation in child rearing and education, and the new emancipation of parents have prompted new demands on children for intellectual and emotional independence. A 3rd factor affecting adults through their child is loss of faith in reason, science, and technology to promote human progress. Emphasis on the uniqueness and homogeneity of youth and the discrepancy between what adults and children believe were cited as examples of how adults misinterpret the effect of social changes on their children. Such changes were mentioned as potential source of conflict. It was recommended that professionals acknowledge the problem, educate parents about responsibilities evolving from their new personal freedoms and that they be aware of the social pressures on parent-child difficulties.

AB- Revised an earlier form of a personality inventory intended to discriminate the relatively emotionally disturbed from the relatively emotionally stable. The present inventory contains 40 items, 20 relating to neuroticism and 10 each to introversion and extraversion. The correlation between the neurotic-related items and Raman's neurotic inventory is .68, significant at the .01 level. It is felt that the current, shortened form of the inventory is easier to administer and places less stress on the S than the earlier form. When administered to engineering students, employed and unemployed engineers, and managerial people, it was found that (a) engineering students were extraverted while managerial people were introverted; (b) more neurotic trends appeared in the unemployed than in the employed; and (c) engineering students were more extraverted than unemployed engineers. Details of the determination of reliability of the items are given. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

The attrition rate for the weekly casework group was significantly lower than the minimal group. It is concluded that high therapist motivation, defined time limits, and informal milieu were influencing factors. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

This federal project established a model of public and volunteer agencies working together; local and state funding continued a long-term program.

AB- Describes a program for placing children in foster homes and exploring the full range of sustaining and modifying interfamilial relationships. The residence was a group setting with group treatment methods. 6 families with 6-11 yr. old children who required long-term placement were selected for the project. Research was conducted during the 3 yr. on effectiveness of the center in facilitating contact between children and their natural parents. 9 children placed were compared with a control group of 13 children entering foster care and 10 children already placed in foster care homes. Children in the center and natural parents saw each other more frequently and parents had a wider range of involvement than did those in the control groups.

KP- implications for casework practice
SU- Conflict; Social Casework
AB- Examines the concept of social conflict in terms of its usefulness in refining and extending social casework theory. The influence of the homeostatic approach to casework practice vs. an approach utilizing a conflict orientation is noted. L. Coser's sociological theory of conflict is emphasized in an effort to discover heuristic concepts applicable to the practice of social casework. Specifically, 7 of Coser's original 16 propositions related to conflict theory were analyzed. It is concluded that a conflict orientation would serve to clarify the functional aspects of conflict as they relate to the dyadic casework relationship. (22 ref.)

KP- human interactions & reactions at crisis-point of admission into residential care
SU- Hospital Admission; Residential Care Institutions
AB- Most separate social work agencies used to have, or still do have, clients entering specific forms of residential care. Since the reorganization of the social services, a local authority social worker is likely to meet a much wider range of people requiring periods of care away from home. Some generic aspects of reception into residential care are considered. Human interactions and reactions at the crisis-point of admission are discussed, and ways are suggested to ease the impact of admission for all parties, especially for the new entrant. It is concluded that if some of these suggestions sound incongruous when applied to penal institutions, then it is debatable whether such places can provide helpful care. (30 ref.)

The original group of 11 18-31 yr. old males was given intensive prerelease group counseling, intensive postdischarge follow-up, and continuing community services. The entire group maintained contact with the project staff for at least 6 mo. Compared to a matched group of misdemeanants, they committed fewer total offenses and had a much lower rate of serious felonies in the follow-up period. During the 1st 2 yr., 133 individuals participated in 1 or more group sessions including misdemeanants, former offenders, nonoffenders, and wives and girl friends of group members. Program development and expansion and the use of indigenous former offenders as paraprofessionals are described and discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Reviewed 61 articles on the use of groups by social workers. Results indicate an underutilization of group potential and the imposition of worker goals when other needs were in evidence. The majority of the groups were treatment oriented, aimed for personal growth, and used discussion as the sole interaction. Few articles indicated any recognition or utilization of the group processes, considered members' perceptions of the group purpose, or discussed conflicts between the members' and workers' goals. When divergence of goals was noted, it tended to revolve around the worker's desire for therapeutic goals and the members' desire for environmental change. Articles concerning group work with welfare recipients, unwed mothers, the aged, and tenants are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

SU- Drug Abuse; Drug Rehabilitation; Heroin; Heroin Addiction
AB- Briefly considers the pharmacological characteristics of heroin, its history of usage, and its properties in the "drug culture." The history of the social response to heroin in the United States is traced from the mid-1800s with emphasis on legal and medical policies. Estimates are presented of the number of heroin addicts, and the social costs in the areas of individual rights, crime, and alienation are discussed. It is proposed that the drug problem is one of abuse rather than use. It is suggested that (a) the penalties for possession of small quantities of drugs for personal use be removed, (b) marihuana be legalized with controls such as those for alcohol, and (c) community drug centers be opened where heroin would be available at little or no cost for both addicts and nonaddicts. The inclusion of nonaddicts is considered as a method for establishing a climate of prevention through the provision of information and motivational feedback in a nonthreatening atmosphere.

It was found that home science students are the best informed, followed by economics, psychology, and sociology. On the other hand, the ranking is reversed with regard to practice. The importance of this finding to social work educators is noted, because the home science students who seem to have a better appreciation of social work needs are less likely to pursue a course in social work than the sociology students who rank lower in the "awareness" part of the study.

KP- personality abnormalities & prior psychiatric referral & social maladjustment
KP- soft to hard drug use progression
KP- adolescent females
SU- Drug Usage; Marijuana Usage; Narcotic Drugs; Personality Disorders
AB- Identified illicit-drug users among the girls admitted to a remand home over a 2-yr period. 194 of 1,088 Ss had used cannabis or amphetamines prior to admission and a further 33 had used narcotics. These and 100 matched control admissions were studied for a subsequent 3-yr period with results indicating that 40 soft-drug users (but only 1 control) had progressed to hard-drug or narcotic use. 90 Ss were selected for further detailed follow-up and divided into 3 groups: those who were taking narcotics on admission, progressor, and nonprogressor groups. The items which most significantly distinguished the 3 groups were those relating to prior personality abnormalities, prior psychiatric referral, and difficulty in relating to peers and to adults. It is suggested that these differences are of prognostic importance and may aid early identification of soft-drug users most vulnerable to progression to narcotics. (18 ref.)

AB- Reports findings on the depressed woman's performance as a mother to her adolescent children during her illness and recovery. The social functioning of 40 25-60 yr. old women was compared with that of a group of nonsymptomatic controls. Clinical data on the mother-child interaction were obtained in the course of the psychiatric or casework treatment. Information on the adolescents of the control group was obtained during the mother's research assessments. A high degree of impaired communication, resentment, disaffection, and hostility was observed in the depressed mothers toward their adolescent children. After 8 mo. of treatment for depression, their parental performance had improved considerably in all areas. However, Ss were still somewhat more impaired than the controls, especially in their ability to communicate with their children. (21 ref.)

AB- Piaget's developmental theory was used as a base for developing a theoretical orientation toward adult (graduate social work students) learning. It is asserted that conceptual teaching is the most productive approach to the problem of coordinating class-field learning. Thus, learning was discussed in terms of "primary learning processes, adult concept attainment, factors in effective learning, problems in adult learning, and products of learning." (28 ref.)

AB- Presents findings from a review of the literature, an ongoing study of acutely depressed female patients, and a comparison of 40 depressed and 40 matched normal women. It is concluded that (a) depressive illness puts considerable strain on any marriage, (b) children are highly vulnerable to their mother's depressive disorder, (c) the depressed patient's expression of hostility varies with the relationship, (d) the infrequent patient who is hostile during intervals may be suicidal, (e) depressed patients are usually conscientious in keeping appointments, (f) depressed patients tend to focus on current practical family problems rather than etiologies, and (g) symptomatic recovery may precede improved social functioning. Implications for casework are discussed. (28 ref.) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

KP- loneliness & isolation & demographic characteristics
KP- 'hot line' for widowed callers
SU- Demographic Characteristics; Hot Line Services; Loneliness; Social Isolation; Widows
AB- Describes a project in a large urban area aimed at providing mutual help for the widowed through a "hot line." Data from records of 570 calls received during an 8 mo. period indicate that approximately 73% of the callers were experiencing loneliness and isolation. Callers were generally women (90%), ranged in age from 24-90 (modal age 51-60), and had been widowed in the last 2 yr. (46%). Younger callers were more likely to be seeking new relationships, while older Ss were more likely to be seeking a listener. While the majority of Ss (61%) were unemployed, employment did not reduce loneliness: 50% of those employed full time asked for aid in making new friends. Widowers were more likely to want to make new friends and less likely to ask for practical information unless they had young children at home. Additional findings indicate that finances were not regarded as a major problem and that professionals (clergy and others) had offered little assistance to the bereaved. Actions taken by the volunteers are noted. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- The Hindi version of an adaptation of the Maudsley Personality Inventory, measuring Neuroticism (N) and Extroversion (E) was administered to 440 college students suspected of cheating in final exams, and to 440 college students not suspected. It was found that violators have higher N and higher E scores. There is a discussion of the findings. It is felt that Eysenck's conclusions that psychopaths and criminals are high on N and E, are supported. (32 ref.) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)

Social work's solution has been biracial adoption; however, the dangers of such an approach both to the black child and the white adoptive parents are discussed. Although total abandonment of biracial adoption is not advocated, it is concluded that in this society only black families can assure an environment in which there is optimal opportunity for growth, development, and identification.

KP- ideologies of need
KP- social work department organization
SU- Social Casework
AB- Explains variations between Scottish social work departments regarding the way in which clients and professionals are mutually allocated for service provision. Through the analysis of semistructured interviews and observational data, a framework is generated for the conduct of further comparative research. The material presented suggests that in order to understand the organizational procedures of a social work department it is important to pay particular attention to the sets of meanings (ideologies) which professional social workers themselves assign to their work and the organization of which they are a part. An account of the organizational procedures in social work is seen to entail an account of professional ideologies about social need. The data indicate that need-ideologies are multidimensional in character and may be distinguished in terms of the unit, and assessor of need. It is suggested that the allocation procedures current in social work departments may be seen as attempts, varying in degrees of success, to implement a number of need-ideologies at the operational level.

SU- Behavior Disorders; Parental Attitudes; Social Class
AB- 200 parents gave their views in a structured open-ended questionnaire. 77 parents admitted to having a child who behaved maladaptively. These parents were the "problem" group, and the remaining were regarded as the "normal" group. It was found, at a statistically significant level, that parents in the "problem" group would tend to avoid seeking help if their child had the problem under discussion. Yet these same parents would advise treatment of a child with a different type of maladaptive problem. It is suggested that this inconsistent response indicates the operation of ego defense mechanisms. Social class variation had less effect upon parents' attitudes than had been expected. (27 ref.)

AB- Examines the implications of racism in the therapeutic relationship between a minority client and white worker. The contention is stressed that common background is less important than many claim and that special training can help compensate for differences between worker and client. Early in their training, social workers learn to subject themselves to critical self-examination with regard to their feelings toward clients. To overcome the blocks to interracial worker-client relationships, they must use this technique to examine how their racial attitudes affect their work with minority clients. Only then will they reach their professional goal of serving all clients effectively. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

KP- social worker-client racial difference
KP- casework relationship
SU- Clients; Racial and Ethnic Differences; Social Casework; Social Workers
AB- Discusses findings on the subject of whether racial differences between the social worker and client create insurmountable obstacles to the casework relationship. Although nonwhite workers may be necessary for nonwhite clients in some instances and therapeutically desirable in others, it is concluded that white workers can and have worked effectively with nonwhite clients. Although race is considered to be important, the nature of the interpersonal relationship established between 2 people is more important than skin color, and although there are disadvantages to racially mixed worker-client contacts, there are special advantages. Conversely, there are special advantages to racial similarity and there are countervailing disadvantages, i.e., each encounter presents a unique situation. Differences in sex, age, and political and personal ideologies are considered as well as race. To talk in terms of white and nonwhite is to simplify dichotomously a variegated situation that includes many kinds of whites and nonwhites.

KP- rehabilitation while still using drugs
KP- young heroin addict
SU- Case Report; Drug Addiction; Drug Rehabilitation
AB- Presents the case history and describes the therapy of a young drug addict to illustrate the possibility of achieving significant change in an addict while he is still using drugs. The rehabilitation process is divided into 3 stages: (a) establishing a stable drug dosage for the S and reorganizing his social situation so that it does not work against therapy attempts; (b) weaning the S from drugs, either suddenly or gradually; and (c) lending help and support as the S learns to cope with new stresses when he returns to society in the new role of a "normal person" and "nonaddict." In retrospect, 3 important points of the S's therapy were noted: the staff's acceptance of him, achievement of significant change while S was still on drugs, and work with the S's family.

KP- social class & number of children & ages & mother working
KP- day & time preferences for appointments
KP- social work cases in child guidance center
SU- Child Guidance Clinics; Client Characteristics; Family Size; Social Casework; Social Class
AB- Examined the effects of an appointment system on client convenience and client preferences of appointments in an educational child guidance center. 11 hypotheses were formulated. A consecutive sample of 100 new and ongoing cases was analyzed in relation to the following variables: (a) social class, (b) number of children in the family, (c) presence of preschool children, and (d) mother working. It was found that of the appointments kept, 29% of new cases and 24% of the ongoing cases felt inconvenienced; 30% of the sample would prefer to be seen on the weekend; and, of the 30% who wanted an evening appointment, weekdays were preferred. The main factors which influenced these choices were social class, mother working, and father's availability. It is apparent that there are definite preferences for days and times which are not always in keeping with agency practice. This has direct implications for the provision of social work help at least for the area studied and perhaps for social service departments in general.

AB- Discusses cultural values and patterns of behavior among Mexican-Americans and barriers to assimilation in an alien society that demand adaptation of the initial contact phases of social work. Patterns of living which are unique to  Mexican-Americans are described and special attention is given to communication, attitudes toward the law, influence of religion, role of the male, and the significance of the extended family. How social work method was adapted to provide effective counseling and achieve agency-client partnership is illustrated through a case example of a Mexican-American family with marital as well as legal difficulties.

SU- Autism; Mothers
AB- Reports a study of mothers of 25 autistic children showing they were the victims of psychic over-determination. It is suggested that the treatment of the mother should parallel the treatment of the child. Just as the child needs to develop, so the mother needs to build her own identity, her knowledge of herself, her capacities, and her abilities. Insight is a distant goal, and for most mothers it may be neither obtainable nor desirable. Improvements in self-esteem, self-observation, and in relationships with others, including the atypical child, are suggested as feasible goals.

The following steps are proposed to further the efforts of organizations, e.g., the American Indian study centers, to promote harmony and friendship: (a) to design programs for urban Indians that offer them the opportunity and stimulate their motivation to share in the control of their destiny; and (b) to provide equal treatment where equality does not now exist, initiating programs which promote fairness and justice e.g., in education, work opportunities, and housing.

KP- black power movement & community control

SU- Black Power Movement; Social Casework
AB- Explores issues involved in the contemporary liberation struggles of black people, examines components of the black agenda for action, and identifies some areas of potential conflict. The choice between separatism and integration, as traditionally viewed by whites, is not a principal issue at hand since these concepts represent strategies rather than ends in themselves. An understanding of certain decisive issues related to community control can help social workers, community planners, and other environmental interventionists come to grips with primary problems affecting any potential work in areas populated by blacks and other ethnic minorities. It is pointed out that the black movement toward self-determination and community control has unleashed strong countervailing forces among the upward-climbing poor whites who have emerged into the marginal middle class. Social workers need to reorient their work and retool their practice to conform to the needs, aspirations, and directions of black people and the other ethnic minorities they serve. Specific suggestions for black as well as white social workers are included. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

SU- Adoption (Child); Adoptive Parents
AB- Describes a 4-mo adoption project using innovative techniques for hard-to-place children. 113 applicants were randomly assigned to the regular department and 85 to the project. No initial telephone interviews were conducted with project applicants: those who expressed interest were invited to the agency for group or individual meetings. Applicants were shown pictures of children awaiting adoption, given information about the project, and a description of the adoption process. Applicants who expressed an interest in any of the children were then interviewed and discussed with the worker the child's needs and his probable impact on the family. The project succeeded in placing 19 children with 17 families; the department placed 32 children. The project was more successful in transracial and older children (over 1 yr. of age) placements. Results indicate that the project applicants' participation in the decision-making process was beneficial to the placement of older children. The family characteristics, the quality of placements, and applicant and project team reactions are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Reports the 1st-yr findings of a 5-yr study on some of the basic assumptions of social work using 624 children placed in foster care agencies. Worker stability, size of caseload, workers' training and experience, and the intensity of attention to the family were examined in relation to the outcomes for the children: (a) discharge to improved family, (b) stable long-term placement, (c) discharge to unchanged family situation, and (d) unstable long-term placement. The stable experienced social workers with low caseloads who were able to work intensively with the children and families had a significant effect in placing the children in a stable environment. Only 1 variable, intensity of contact, had any effect on family improvement. The relationship between caseload and outcome was bimodal: the proportion of children discharged home was highest for those with the lowest and highest caseloads. Findings tend to support and to qualify the basic assumptions of social work. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

Because of the time-limited nature of the groups, they provide a valuable opportunity for training students and new workers in group process, child development, and family dynamics. The program described was an outreach approach of taking the service to the people. Only 1 of the 8 groups was conducted within the agency. The others were in churches, community centers, state agencies, and institutions. Lines of communication were opened between neighborhood residents and the power structure and resulted in improved utility services, health clinics, and day care centers.

It is concluded that poor economic standing of the family creates a stimulus for better career orientation and competition as compared to higher family economic levels. Students from congenial home situations are likely to adjust more effectively to college life. In general, a reciprocal relationship between scholastic achievement, family pattern, conduct, and college atmosphere exists, with social training and family pattern being influential factors. College friendships tend to be with students of similar family backgrounds, reinforcing the effect of the home on values, and providing feedback on the respective achievement of the students.

Science attracted the youngest and social work the oldest student population. Social work experience is associated with the existence of a Social Service League in college, higher age, and certain faculties. It is concluded that social work as a profession is not yet established. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

SU- Management; Mental Health; Models; Organizational Structure
AB- With an increasing number of mental health professionals working in a wide variety of community and social welfare organizations, the author sees an increased need for concepts from organizational theory. In historical perspective, some of the main trends in the literature are reviewed concerning organizational and management models that are unfamiliar to most clinically oriented mental health professionals. In order to develop a set of tentative action concepts consistent with the complexity of mental health tasks now being undertaken, a variety of helping interventions to these models are given. Some principles that delineate the linkages between this mixture of models and concepts are proposed. (51 ref.) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Traditional studies have viewed the problem of labor commitment in terms of workers' reluctance to relinquish rural links for a firm allegiance to the labor market. This discussion assumes that worker behavior represents "conditioning" rather than commitment to work. Therefore the focus is shifted from the worker's commitment to industrial employment to their commitment to work. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

The therapist must be aware of his own value dilemma as well as that of his patients. In working with adolescents, the therapist must be particularly careful to determine what a given value judgment means to a particular individual. 2 cases are cited in which young men opposed the Vietnam war for very different underlying reasons.

The sample consisted of 157 families with foster children aged 6 yr. and older. Data included the child's sex, date of placement, and scores on the WISC or WAIS, and foster parents' religion, occupation, and reasons for wanting a foster child. Results indicate that successful placements (i.e., those that had survived 2 or more years) were related to several interacting factors, including (a) older age of the parents, (b) presence of other foster or natural children, and (c) parents' general interest in helping a child.

KP- discussion of sexual problems
KP- embarrassment & societal taboos
KP- clinets & social workers
SU- Ethics; Psychosexual Behavior; Social Casework
AB- Discusses the reluctance of clients and social workers to discuss the client's sexual problems. Although both parties may feel embarrassed or sexually inadequate, the most significant difficulty is the professional risk in suggesting desirable solutions that may overstep hazy legal or ethical boundaries. It is concluded that workers must maximize the choices of the profession's constituency and minimize those limitations of sexual expression that reflect dysfunctional societal taboos or ignorance.

A treatment program of motivational progression is described, in which the patient (a) is confronted with his addiction, (b) develops an intellectual understanding of why he uses drugs, (c) develops an intellectual conviction that drugs are harmful, and (d) develops an awareness of the role his feelings play in his addiction. The successful rehabilitation of several addicts through these means is discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Administered a modified form of the Allport Ascendance-Submission (A-S) Test to 14 groups of men including engineering students, employed engineers, supervisors, applicants for supervisory jobs, unemployed artisans, and applicants for clerical positions. Results show that engineering students were the most submissive of the groups and humanities students more ascendant. Differences between the leader and nonleader groups and the engineering students were significant. It is suggested that the A-S test alone is not sufficient for employment purposes. Aptitude, IQ, and other tests should also be considered. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

Data generally support the hypothesis that respondents with a high degree of powerlessness will significantly more frequently display extended family orientation and authoritarian attitudes toward children. It is noted that these attitudes deviate from the predominant orientation of Americans toward family and children as expressed in the typical model family system.

Findings indicate that Ss are greatly influenced by the nature of conceptual material used to develop understanding of a client. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

SU- Behavior Therapy; Genital Disorders; Phobias; Social Casework
AB- Argues "that recent developments in behaviour therapy demand a much more radical revision of the role of the psychiatric social worker in a behavioural modification team." The author has been a member of a behavior therapy team which includes a psychiatrist and 2 psychologists. This team has had "a special interest in the use of behaviour therapy to treat patients with phobic and sexual disorders . . . . " The use of the patient's relatives and other key figures in the treatment of maladaptive behavior is discussed. Also discussed is the history of behavior therapy from the generalization gradient, stimulus generalization, and resistance to extinction to the more recent model of transfer and persistence of behavior using concepts of stimulus and response classes. Case histories are presented to illustrate that stimuli linked by social training are not easily seen "when examining the idiosyncratic and unexpected relationships between stimuli controlling either phobic behaviour or sexual behaviour in patients with personal problems . . . . Behaviour therapy requires the selection of a training procedure which will generate adaptive behaviour that will fit into the individual's social environment so that it will be reinforced." The 3 strategies that have been suggested to accomplish this are discussed. It is concluded that it is clear "that social workers can play an important professional role in present behavioural programmes." (29 ref.)

AB- Reports on a study "designed to investigate -a= the material needs and changes in the way of life of those who become chronically dependent on a machine for life or essential bodily function . . . . -b= the reactions and attitudes of individuals to their disability and dependence . . . . -and c= the type and extent of material and emotional help, currently available or desirable, for the patients" during adjustment to their disability and machines in the hospital, when transferred home, and during subsequent years. There were 6 Ss dependent on respiratory aids, 6 dependent on power-driven wheelchairs, and 6 on kidney machines. Data were collected by interviews. Ages, "duration of disability and of independent living, social class, marital status and number of children were analysed, followed by a consideration of the practical problems of money, gadgets, space and help." Results indicate the need for additional support in all aspects of a machine-dependent life. (21 ref.) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)

Case examples are presented to show how social workers may use sociobehavioral theory in case and group work; these involve operant crying and extinction, and anxiety and systematic desensitization. The questions of ethics, existing practical knowledge, and dynamic theory are considered, acknowledging the need for personality as well as sociobehavioral theories.

KP- multiprofessional services project for social & vocational adjustment

SU- Brain Damage; Rehabilitation; Schizophrenia; Treatment; Vocational Rehabilitation
AB- Describes an 8-yr project employing multiprofessional services designed to facilitate social and vocational adjustment of 79 17-22 yr. Olds who were receiving inpatient psychiatric treatment at the time of referral. 90% of the patients were diagnosed as schizophrenic by the referring source. Special attention was given to (a) differentiating patients in whom organic brain damage was a factor, (b) transition points in treatment, (c) flexible use of assignment to a community-based therapeutic workshop, and (d) identifying maturational problems. Caseworkers were seen as coordinating the various services on behalf of individual patients as well as offering direct services to the patient and family. The outcomes of the project were rated by a caseworker who was not on the project staff, according to a 6-point scale. 62% of the patients were in the 3 more favorable categories. Education and iq were found to be significant in predicting outcomes. Positive motivation was apparently not an essential factor in predicting outcome.

AB- Describes autism in order to show some of the difficulties which arise when working with the parents of autistic children. Social and behavioral implications are considered, noting 3 problems which social workers must investigate: (a) the expectations that parents have for the child, (b) guilt and the allocation of blame, and (c) the child's placement in an institution or training program. Regarding the continuing treatment situation, 5 points are discussed: (a) the need for practical help, (b) the emotional problems and pressures on the family, (c) the need to stimulate maternal interest and love, (d) help for the overly protective mother, and (e) consideration of the whole family. 2 problems which were considered to be particularly difficult for parents of autistic children are emphasized. These include the wide intellectual gap that often exists between parents and child, and the vulnerability of such parents to lack of community sympathy because of the lack of compassion associated with autistic behavior.

When institutional personnel discourage the extension of the outside community into the institution, residents and patients may react with apathy and hopelessness. Group work should provide older participants with leisure-time pursuits to help them assume personally satisfying life roles. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

Old members since its inception in 1966 and has an average membership of 6. Members have been broadly classified into 2 categories: acting out and withdrawn. It is noted that group members have the same basic difficulties as normal adolescents, but experience crippling anxiety and seem to lack protective defenses. Experience has shown that any increase in stress may injure the treatment process. Methods for controlling anxiety are discussed. It was found that a heterosexual group tends to provoke too much anxiety, but that male and female therapist leadership seems to facilitate a valuable reexperience of family themes.

AB- Reports results from a survey of 47 25-70 yr. Old british psychiatric social workers who appeared to be employed full time in a mental hospital. The objective was to investigate how these workers perceive some aspects of their role, and relationships with other professional workers. 34% of ss reported that they may be in the process of moving because of job dissatisfaction, the major factor being salary. It was also noted that ss may be becoming too patient centered, but are making favorable contributions in group work and collaboration in nurse training. It is suggested that hospitals make policy decisions aimed at retaining psychiatric social workers. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

SU- Child Psychotherapy; Social Casework; Child Guidance
AB- Discusses child guidance from the vantage point of the experienced psychiatric social worker. There is role uncertainty, with perhaps a shift away from traditional clinical services and toward wider community consultation and involvement. Ignorance of the function and availability of the child guidance clinic was found in a survey of parents within easy reach of services in the london area. Such clinics are seen as functioning now in many ways as a screening center for adult psychiatric referrals, with the child's symptoms being the initial signal which leads to parents obtaining help. Of 54 children referred in a 3 mo-period, it was found that in all cases it was the parental illness which primarily required psychiatric help. It is considered essential for newcomers to receive immediate intervention in "walk-in" centers with contacts taken by on-the-line professionals and nonprofessionals. The movement of child guidance clinics in that direction is encouraged. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

This reflects increasing satisfaction in working in the setting, with the widening possibilities for active community work, teaching, consulting, and administrative assignments. The nature of referrals has also been changing over the years with the focus increasingly upon the family and early preventive work. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

KP- psychiatric social worker
KP- role in teaching hospital
SU- Graduate Psychology Education; Psychiatric Hospitals; Social Casework
AB- Few psychiatric social workers are left within the teaching hospital and they face an uncertain future. However, it is felt that the active pace of the hospital setting with its constantly changing and crowded therapeutic scene provides an excellent opportunity for the psychiatric social worker. This is a rich environment for learning, teaching, and sharing with the larger community. The psychiatric teaching hospital offers invaluable training experience for all professional social work students. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Maintains that the hard-to-reach poor, hostile toward social agencies and defiant of authority do not reject services as a matter of choice but as an act of despair. The poor have never had any options from which they could make a choice. When they are offered full participation in the choice of specific services and in the evaluation of the results of these services, they will not only accept but cooperate in and profit from these services. 3 case illustrations are presented.

KP- legal sources & minimal criminal activity
KP- nonnarcotic drug abusers
SU- Drug Usage
AB- Drug abuse has often been viewed within the single frame of reference of "heroin-street" addiction. This study attempts to broaden this criminal model by describing a drug-abusing population largely unknown to law enforcement personnel the "nonnarcotic" drug abusers. Using data drawn from a study of 10 such persons, a profile of this group is presented. In contrast with the heroin addict, criminal activities are almost nonexistent and drugs are obtained from legal sources. This group is therefore hidden from detection by law enforcement personnel. It is noted that 90% of the nonnarcotic drug abusers became addicted to the barbiturates and sedative-like drugs. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

SU- Emotions; Mothers; Parent Child Relations; Personality
AB- Investigated the association between persistence of mourning in 26 foster children and the foster mother's level of functioning. Findings strongly suggest that the foster mother's functioning affects the child's manner of coping with grief and his interpersonal relationships. Children living with the "need-bestowing" foster mothers were less expressive of feelings about loss, especially anger, more passive and submissive in their interpersonal relationships, and less invested in school and family tasks. Fantasies of these children revealed that they were less able to cope with feelings about loss and more prone to feel depression, incompetence, and a sense of rage.

AB- Attempted to relate the attitudes of 6 mental health social workers to the emergency psychiatric situation. 5 hypotheses were tested concerning comparisons of professionally trained vs. Nontrained personnel: number of statutory admissions, compulsory admissions, sex of officer, perception of the situation as therapeutic, and motives toward working in the field of mental health. Data consisted of departmental records and subjective interviews with ss. Results indicate that social workers disliked the emergency situation, exaggerated the number of such situations, did not view them as casework, and that many family crises remained unsolved. Findings are discussed in the light of crisis intervention theory which might enable the caseworker to view the psychiatric emergency situation as potentially therapeutic for the client and his family.

AB- Using an n of 100, this study reports on the results of 2 oral contraceptives, observing the same women for at least 12 cycles. The acceptability, side effects, effectiveness, and tolerance for these contraceptives were assessed for different socioeconomic groups. Sexual aspects, including frequency of coitus, was also measured. It was felt that the pill program, while slow in developing, would be aided by increased education, and that government subsidy would aid in motivation.

Major emphasis is on universal psychological tasks that become critical during transitional periods in the family's life cycle. In the family system, the individual's development is conditioned not only by his own biopsychological needs and motives but also by the needs and motives of the other family members and by the needs of the family as a whole.

SU- Consciousness States; Ethnology; Prejudice; Stereotyped Attitudes
AB- Focuses on individual and institutional racism resulting from stereotyping. This racism might be considered unintentional, disguised, and on a preconscious level. The concept of the collective preconscious is developed as contributing to white racism which apprears to be passed on from generation to generation. Examples of the media's portrayal of mexican-americans are presented to demonstrate how the media may unintentionally be contributing to white racism through stereotyping. 3 approaches to combating racism are suggested: (a) ethnic minority students and faculty can help make social work more conscious of racism in and out of the profession, (b) social work can use social action to try to influence those forces that become part of the racial preconscious, and (c) more research can be done in understanding the impact of white racism on minority group children.

SU- Community Services; Mental Health; Psychiatric Patients; Rehabilitation; Treatment
AB- Describes a program in which the community, state mental hospitals, and a community mental health center cooperate in providing an environment conducive to the continued well-being of chronic mental patients discharged from state hospitals. Data are presented from 64 female and 36 male patients who had been hospitalized for a mean duration of 9.1 yr., and were predominately schizophrenic and unmarried. Day care facilities were located as close as possible to Ss' place of residence. The Ss' self-government council determined and implemented programs for individuals and groups of patients. Activities involved learning social, interaction, and occupational skills. Individual and group counseling facilities are described, and problems of Ss living in the community are noted. Evaluation of the program after 3 yr. indicates (a) a 9% recidivism rate after 18 mo., (b) yearly costs of approximately 1/3 that required for state hospitalization, and (c) reduction in the amount of medication required for 63% of the Ss.

It seems to work well with the student who is somewhat threatened by supervision. Having one's weaknesses or mistakes pointed out by colors on a piece of paper appears less painful and dilutes the personal threats that certain students experience with supervisors.

AB- Describes a multimodality treatment program for narcotic addicts which is primarily geared to the goal of abstinence. The psychotherapeutic continuum serves to help those addicts who can benefit at a particular level and to screen those in need of more intensive treatment. Treatment includes inpatient or ambulatory detoxification, low-dose methadone, high-level variable dose methadone maintenance, and residential center living with methadone maintenance. Each level is described and a case example presented to illustrate various principles. It is concluded that such a multimodality approach makes a definite contribution to the rehabilitation of addicts who might not otherwise be reached by more limited programs.

SU- Graduate Students; Language; Philosophies; Social Casework
AB- In order to determine whether social work, as a distinct body of knowledge, may be assisted in changing some of its basic concepts through the use of philosophy, a year-long tutorial project was undertaken. Both remedial and substantive aid was given to a selected group of 7 students working in graduate programs in social work. The focal areas were: (a) difficulty in understanding the genesis of abstract psychological terminology; (b) confusion as to how theoretical concepts relate to an analysis of psychological disorders; and (c) the general role of inference in diagnosing a psychological impairment. There were some difficulties in the students' comprehension of theoretical concepts. It was felt that some use of contemporary language philosophy can aid social work students in understanding abstract terminology. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

KP- teaching parents use of behavioral methods
KP- parents of children exhibiting acting out & aggressive & hyperkinetic behavior
SU- Aggressive Behavior; Behavior Problems; Behavior Therapy; Mental Disorders; Parent Child Relations
AB- The Cleveland Child Guidance Center set up a Child Management Group which used a didactic approach emphasizing social learning and reinforcement theory. 4 sets of parents whose children were exhibiting acting-out, aggressive, or hyperkinetic behavior were selected to participate in a 10-wk "course." 2 therapists, a psychologist and a caseworker, led the sessions. Analysis of the parents' responses to the evaluation forms, aimed at understanding of their expectation and the degree to which the group met their needs, and the therapists' view of these families and treatment course showed that behavioral methods did not complete the treatment program for the families. The children felt they were being manipulated and the object of a study. The project appeared to have limited success with children and families and to provide a basis for further therapy. Behavioral techniques are an additional tool for use with distressed children and families but do not replace discussion, play techniques, and counseling.

AB- Although it represents a small, wealthy district with funds, personnel, and leisure to develop programs, the experiences of the Orange School System in a pilot study are relevant to the widespread crisis in schools today. Because of the study, the school district altered its approach to the unreachable, nonreferable child. It has designated funds for personnel who could be with students, talk to them, and most important, listen to them. Results showed all the children concluded the year reading on their proper 3rd grade level, higher than the national 3rd grade norm. The teacher's comments were positive concerning improved social adjustment, increased interest, effort put forth by a child, better conforming to classroom routine, better group acceptance, and lessened tension.

SU- Paranoia (Psychosis); Social Casework
AB- Emotionally healthy persons can align their false belief systems with those of their relatives, friends, schoolmates, and culture mates. By employing camouflaging labels they can avoid awareness of the paranoia. All such group members are sociable healthy persons who have aligned their paranoia to that of other persons to whom they have affiliative bonds. Their group is right and outsiders are wrong. Their paranoia is nonpathological because their capacity for social relationships is intact enough for their paranoia to be group-related.

AB- Since 1965, the Verbal Interaction Project, has explored a new means of preparing 2- and 3-yr-old children of low-income families for the good school achievement vital to breaking the cycle of poverty. The method encourages dialogue between mother and child. The project is based on research evidence that a child's intellectual development is closely linked to his verbal growth and that his mother can influence his cognitive development by the amount and quality of her verbal interaction with him. Results confirmed the ability of the project to raise significantly the initially relatively low mean verbal and general IQs of these children over controls.

Goals suitable for open-ended and planned-timed treatment center around: (a) developing healthier coping patterns; (b) building the ego; (c) developing reality orientation through work, marriage, and parenthood; (d) promoting object relationships, increasing frustration tolerance; and (e) reinforcing cognitive development.

Parents must be involved in treatment, and their authority strengthened so that proper care and vigilance can be maintained. The therapist must also discourage the repeated discussion of drugs since this only helps the child to relive the drug experience. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Reports on a study to determine the effect of transfers on the mortality rate of geriatric psychiatric patients. Variables studied were age, sex, race, organic or functional diagnosis, length of hospitalization, and whether Ss were ambulatory at the time of transfer. Mortality rates were significantly higher for the transfer group (N = 144) especially for the older, nonambulatory patients than for those Ss (N = 109) who had remained in their home units. The need to establish policies that keep the Ss' interests firmly in mind and that are cognizant of the effects of environmental change, especially on the aged, is emphasized.

Specific issues are discussed, and it is proposed that behavioral psychology can deal adequately with all important aspects of complex human behavior.

Responses were used to classify Ss into 2 distinct groups, and a sample was selected from each for intensive interviews. Early life experiences of the adoptive couples were found to be only minimally associated with their performance as parents. The adoptive couples tended to reinforce their own disciplinary experiences as children with their adoptive child. No relationship was found between nature of infertility and performance as parents. A substantial number of the children experienced behavioral difficulties in school and home. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

SU- Defense Mechanisms; Emotions; Psychotherapeutic Processes; Social Casework
AB- A review of the social work and child psychiatry literature revealed an absence of attention to the termination phase of therapy. It is suggested that this gap reflects the social worker's defensive processes against the affects involved in termination, i.e., grief over the loss, anger at the worker for leaving, and narcissistic wounds based on disappointed expectations. 3 phases in the management of these affects are discussed: denial of the impending loss; emotional reaction and expression of sadness, hurt, and anger; and working through of these feelings. A clinical example of a 12-yr-old girl is presented, based on observations during 5 therapy sessions which point up the important aspects of the process, the client's feelings, and the worker's problems in helping the client work through to termination.

It is favored by people in almost all occupation classes. Girls below 16 are usually selected in the cases of 1st marriages, but older females are preferred relatively more at the time of the 2nd marriage. It is felt that incidents of polygyny will diminish as a result of the 1955 Hindu marriage laws in Hindu society, but will continue as before in Muslim society.

The treatment modality is based on the assumption that to reject drugs a patient must: (a) develop substitute satisfactions to be found in work and personal relationships; (b) discover outlets for pent-up emotions; (c) develop techniques to cope with day-to-day problems; (d) expand his threshold of tolerance for suffering, persevering, and delaying gratification; and (e) develop a more aggressive and self-assertive attitude. To accomplish these aims, the program emphasized a work training program to provide job skills and eventual employment. It is stressed that "in the final analysis, success in treatment must be equated with improved functioning rather than total and complete abstinence."

Purposes of the social history include: (a) eliciting a comprehensive picture of the present stage of development of the child; (b) creating an atmosphere which can overcome the parents' anxiety and the child's possible fear, thus helping to establish a positive attitude toward future treatment; and (c) affording an opportunity to check the parents' report of the child against information the child brings directly to the diagnostic examination.

It is concluded that while the choice of treatment models is still imprecise and often guided more by tradition than family needs, progress in delineating various options can be reported.

SU- Crises; Family Therapy; Outpatient Treatment; Psychiatric Hospitals; Social Casework
AB- To compare results of outpatient family crisis therapy with hospitalization, a clinical team from a psychiatric hospital treated on an outpatient basis 186 patients considered acutely in need of admission to a psychiatric hospital. The control group consisted of 150 patients from the same population who were routinely hospitalized. In all except 3 of the initial 36 pilot cases, it was possible to avoid hospitalization. Tenative findings at 6-mo follow-up suggest that family crisis therapy has proved to be a more economical and less stigmatizing form of psychiatric treatment than hospitalization. Its principles are outlined, and the specific participation of the clinical social worker and his role on the crisis therapy team are described.

AB- Studied the child-rearing goals and expectations of mothers of children with learning problems in a comprehensive health clinic for culturally and economically deprived black children. The sample consisted of 15 mothers and 10 boys in each of the groups. Results showed that mothers of boys with school problems expected their children to show earlier competence in areas such as self-feeding, toilet training, and dressing. Mothers of problem children discouraged energetic activities such as climbing, jumping, and sports. These mothers were also more demonstrative physically rather than verbally concerning affection. Mothers of nonproblem children relied on verbal scolding for inappropriate behavior, while mothers of problem children relied primarily on spanking.

AB- 15 Negro and 15 white children, ages 5-7, whose parents consented to their participation in a study, were interviewed concerning components believed to comprise the ego ideal. Ss were presented first with a doll of their own race and then with a doll of the opposite race and asked to judge whether each doll would achieve the child's standards or which would exceed in attainment. Findings showed both groups expressed positive views about prospects for dolls of both races, suggesting that idealizing operations of children may be uncontaminated by racial influences.

This method focuses on helping parents find specific solutions for their children's behavioral and attitudinal problems. Results from a demonstration project are concluded to be sufficiently promising to encourage an expansion of the approach and exploration of the use of additional behavioral procedures to further facilitate the treatment of parents in groups.

AB- Describes and evaluates the characteristics of problem drinkers, treatment services for them, and the place of the halfway house in the mosaic of helping services. Both male and female halfway houses, their admission programs, length of stay, residents' social characteristics, and therapeutic methods are examined. With regard to developments that will affect future programs of halfway houses, it is suggested that some halfway house functions may be taken over by other agencies, but there is 1 important frontier still to be explored; the semiprotective institution, standing halfway between the outpatient service and restrictive, more highly structured hospital-based program. It is emphasized that if cooperation between transitional halfway facilities and official establishments is to be achieved, halfway houses "will have to reach a new status by maintaining minimum standards of care and accepting licensing by state agencies."

AB- Describes the development of an activities program in a home for the aged. The program was designed to offset the dehumanizing aspects of life in an institution that can strip away a person's feelings of identity and independence. It is stressed that for institutions to provide more than custodial care, they must be responsible for the fulfillment of a person's potential and this demands that social workers become agents of change within the institutions.

AB- Suggests that anomie encourages a pattern that leads to emotional disturbance. When anomie is part of an emotional problem the issue of treatment becomes partly philosophical in nature. The state of anomie is described, advantages of existential psychotherapy are cited, and the 5 most important goals of treatment are listed and discussed in detail. These goals include aiding the process of disillusionment, confronting freedom, discovering meaning in suffering, realizing the necessity of dialogue, and accepting the way of commitment. Methods by which these goals may be achieved are presented. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

KP- trauma of separation & disruption of primary relationships & child's understanding & self-image
KP- children placed with relatives
SU- Emotions; Family Relations; Family; Interpersonal Interaction
AB- Children who had been in placement at least 2 yr. were interviewed. Measurements were related to the child's understanding of his status and to his well-being rated by caseworkers familiar with the child. The well-being ratings were found to be independent of the rated level of distortion in the child's description of his placement situation but to vary with his understanding of the agency function and with rated evidence of relationship confusions. This research suggests that placement of a child with a relative itself provides no insulation against the traumatic event of separation and the attendant disruption of primary relationships.

AB- Studied the implications of preadoptive statements of 20 adopting couples about the kind of child they hoped to adopt. Using a retrospective design, couples were seen in a semistructured interview calling for responses relative to parental preadoptive preferences, the child's place in the family, and parents' relationship capabilities as observed in an interview. There was a significant relationship between capacity for object relationships and "acknowledgement of difference" as a coping mechanism. It appears that parents' capacities to relate well in a variety of situations may be a crucial index of their ability to take on adoptive parenthood.

Data suggested the workers had no clearly developed philosophy about relationships with the law. Although they may have been able to distinguish between legal and nonlegal elements of situations, need for a legal referral or consulation was not recognized as easily as need for a medical referral. Most of the workers interviewed articulated an uneasiness about their lack of legal sophistication. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

The group setting also seems to have the potential to change values. It is concluded that the conditions necessary for an environment conducive to change, as shown by these settings, may not be wholly acceptable to the American professional, but that he must surmount the conflict he feels.

Degree of delinquency made no difference. The Franck Drawing Completion Test, the Gough Femininity Scale, semistructured interviews, and secondary data provided demographic information and sex-role profiles used in studying the relationship of delinquent acting-out to male adolescent sexual identification, based on Freud's theory of the process of identification. The importance of the father-son relationship in developing appropriate sexual identification was reinforced in the clinical and personal data.

There will never be an era in which this is no longer a basic requirement. Social casework can also be a therapeutic method. There is the centrality of the helping relationship, a purposeful and consciously directed process involving the use of professional self through which growth and change in the individual can take place. Goals are the enhancement of better personal and interpersonal functioning, a strengthening of the adaptive capacity, and a greater potentiality for self-direction.

AB- Describes a survey of 1,020 members of the New York City Chapter of the National Association of Social Workers to discover their attitudes toward social action strategies and perceptions of their effectiveness by middle- and lower-class persons in housing and welfare reform. It was found that social workers consider themselves most effective when assuming traditional professional roles; they view middle-class persons as most capable in purely political roles and lower-class persons in use of conflict strategies. An analysis of the findings and their implications for future social action movements are presented. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

Over 11% of the group were referred for economic, health, and housing problems. Interviewers were relieved that help was requested, and interviewees were found to be more cooperative. The social context within which the S lives was made manifest and the previously static, unidimensional information became dynamic and multidimensional. Resulting research data may well be richer and more meaningful as a result of provisions of services. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Using 100 Ss (50 from a rural and 50 from an urban area) drawn randomly from different age, sex, and educational status, it was shown that personal factors played an important role in determination of leadership choice. People of middle age, higher education, and from urban areas had a significantly greater preference for a democratic type of leadership. Sex was not a significant factor.

AB- Studied 10 mothers referred by welfare personnel as being inadquate in child-rearing standards. The pilot project was undertaken in rural Southern Appalachia. Data were collected by interviews and psychological testing to profile general personality types. Mothers showed little behavior that could be termed regressive but rather, a massive early arrest and fixation of personality development best understood by their adaptive style and ego functioning. Treatment of these mothers would likely be arduous and long-term. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

Referrals were made by intake workers in public welfare who had been trained to look beyond requests for financial help to see the need for intervention. A review of 50 cases showed that 24 responded positively, 14 dropped out of treatment, 7 did not respond at all, and 5 received help from other sources. With accelerated casework, the presenting problem in 1/2 the cases treated was resolved within 3 mo. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- APPLIES A GAME THEORY MODEL, IN WHICH HUMAN INTERACTION IS MEDIATED BY A COMPLEX PATTERN OF RULES AND ROLE ASSIGNMENTS SO THAT PLAYERS MAY ACHIEVE "HIDDEN PAYOFFS," TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF DEVIANT HUMAN BEHAVIOR. CONCERN WITH A DOMINANCE-SUBMISSION DIMENSION IN AMERICAN CULTURE EQUATES SEEKING HELP WITH DEPENDENCY, AND SO CREATES AND MAINTAINS UNCONVENTIONAL GAME RULES FOR DEPENDENT PERSONS. IN RELATION TO THIS, THE INTERPERSONAL STRATEGIES OF INSTITUTIONALIZED MILDLY RETARDED SS TO DEAL WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL STRUCTURE, MAY DETERMINE THE LEVEL OF ABILITY DEMONSTRATED. 2 GAME EXAMPLES ARE DISCUSSED: (1) THE COURT JESTER GAME, IN WHICH THE RETARDATE AS THE "FOOL" MAY SAFELY INFLICT PAIN AND DISCOMFORT, I.E., MODICUM OF DOMINANCE OVER STAFF MEMBERS; AND (2) THE INCOMPETENCE GAME, IN WHICH PASSIVE SUBMISSION FORCES THE WORKER TO ASSUME ALL RESPONSIBILITY, AND AGAIN THE RETARDATE GAINS A SORT OF PASSIVE-DOMINANCE STATUS. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THE RULES, GAMES, AND ROLES MAY BE CHANGED, AND SOCIAL WORKERS MIGHT CONSTRUCTIVELY MOLD THE SS INTO ROLES ACCEPTED BY THE RULES OF SOCIETY.

CAPACITY TO DEAL WITH THE PROBLEM WAS BASED ON THEIR EGO STRENGTH, AND IT WAS POSSIBLE TO PREDICT WHICH PARENTS WOULD NEED THE MOST CASEWORK SERVICE. JUDICIOUS PROVISION OF SUPPORT AND INTERVENTION ENABLED MOST FAMILIES TO ENDURE THE STRESS.

SU- Social Casework; Stress; Treatment
AB- CRISIS IS SEEN AS AN ENTITY DISTINCT FROM A CHRONIC CONDITION ALTHOUGH AFFECTED BY IT. CRISIS TREATMENT IS NOT A BRIEF FORM OF PSYCHOTHERAPY BUT A UNIQUE TREATMENT ADAPTED TO THE ACUTE SITUATION. AGENCY STRUCTURE DESIGNED TO TREAT CHRONIC PROBLEMS IS NOT SUITABLE FOR CRISIS INTERVENTION. CASEWORKERS MUST BE STRATEGICALLY LOCATED IN THE LIFE SPACE OF THE CLIENT AND IN PHYSICAL PROXIMITY TO THE SCENE OF CONFLICT TO GAIN FIRSTHAND KNOWLEDGE, BE READILY AVAILABLE TO THE CLIENT IN DISTRESS, AND TO OFFER TREATMENT TO OTHERS WHOSE BEHAVIOR INFLUENCES THE CLIENT. CRISIS INTERVENTION OFFERS CASEWORKERS THE OPPORTUNITY TO PERFORM AN IMPORTANT PREVENTIVE FUNCTION. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

SU- Social Casework; Socioeconomic Status
AB- SOCIAL WORKERS HAVE RECENTLY BEEN ACCUSED OF TURNING AWAY FROM THE POOR. IN AN EFFORT TO ANSWER QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE POOR AND THEIR SPOKESMEN, BIBLIOGRAPHIES OF 37 MEN AND 20 WOMEN CONSIDERED SOCIAL WELFARE LEADERS BETWEEN 1890-1914 WERE REVIEWED. RESULTS INDICATE THAT EARLY WORKERS SPOKE FOR THEIR OWN MIDDLE CLASS. THE TASK TODAY IS TO UNDERSTAND NEEDS OF OTHERS AND USE SKILLS AND RESOURCES TO HELP THEM WITHIN THE LIMITS THAT DEFINE SOCIAL WORK. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

THE SUBSTITUTE MOTHERS HAD SLIGHTLY BETTER MENTAL HEALTH THAN THE PATIENTS AND RESPONDED BETTER TO THE BABIES' NEEDS. AFTER LEAVING THE HOSPITAL, 3 OF THE MOTHERS MOVED TO A DIFFERENT HOME AND ALMOST 1/2 HAD ANOTHER BABY. THERE WAS LITTLE DIFFERENCE IN CLEANLINESS AND MOTHER-CHILD INTERACTION BETWEEN MOTHERS WHO BROUGHT THEIR BABIES INTO THE HOSPITAL AND THOSE WHO DID NOT. HOWEVER, THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THEIR MENTAL HEALTH; THE JOINT ADMISSIONS MOTHERS HAD FEWER PROBLEMS IN FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS AND IN REALITY ORIENTATION.

DIFFERENCES IN COMMUNICATION PATTERNS WERE OBSERVED BETWEEN HUSBANDS AND WIVES. HUSBANDS PARTICIPATED LESS ACTIVELY, WERE ORIENTED MORE TO THE PRESENT, EMPHASIZED EVERYDAY CONCERNS OUTSIDE THE MARRIAGE, AND CONCENTRATED LESS ON THEIR OWN BEHAVIOR. WHEN SEXUAL PROBLEMS WERE INTRODUCED, HUSBANDS, IN INDIVIDUAL INTERVIEWS, DISCUSSED THESE MORE INTENSIVELY; HOWEVER, IN JOINT INTERVIEWS, THEY CONCENTRATED LESS ON THE SUBJECT THAN DID THE WIVES.

DATA SOURCES WERE DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARIES OF SIBLING RELATIONSHIPS AND INTERVIEWS WITH FAMILIES AND CHILDREN. AREAS OF INTERACTION AMONG SIBLINGS WERE: WISHES TO BE SIMILAR OR DIFFERENT, FEELINGS OF SUPERIORITY OR INFERIORITY, DEPENDENCY OR INDEPENDENCY, SUPPORT OR DEVALUATION, RIVALRY OR JEALOUSY, SHARING, SEXUAL BEHAVIOR, AND ALLIANCES AGAINST PARENTS, PEERS, OR OUTSIDERS. FAMILY COUNSELORS SHOULD GAIN KNOWLEDGE ABOUT DYNAMICS OF THE SIBLING SUBSYSTEM AND USE THESE FOR THE CHILD'S LEARNING AND GROWTH OR FOR INTERVENTION WHEN DESTRUCTIVE ELEMENTS OCCUR. COUNSELORS SHOULD ALSO EVALUATE CHANGES IN SIBLING SUBSYSTEMS FOR THEIR EFFECT ON MARITAL AND PARENT-CHILD RELATIONSHIPS PARTICULARLY AS THEY RELATE TO THERAPEUTIC GOALS FOR THE ENTIRE FAMILY.

TOPICS DISCUSSED INCLUDE THE DEVELOPMENT OF WORKABLE PROCEDURES, DIFFICULTIES IN TREATMENT AND PROCEDURE, STAFF ORIENTATION AND RESPONSE TO THE LOWER-CLASS PSYCHOTIC PATIENT AND HIS TREATMENT EXPECTATIONS, AND THE NEED FOR CONTINUITY OF CARE.

DESPITE THE CHILDREN'S EARLY EXPERIENCE, 80-82% OF THE ADOPTIONS WERE ASSESSED TO BE SUCCESSFUL. A REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE INDICATES THAT SUCH A SUPPOSEDLY ATYPICAL OUTCOME IS ENCOUNTERED FREQUENTLY. AN EFFORT IS MADE TO EXPLAIN REVERSIBILITY OF TRAUMA ON THE BASIS OF CONSTITUTIONAL, SOCIOLOGICAL, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS. (32 REF.) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

THE CONCEPT OF LOSS UTILIZED IN THIS STUDY ENCOMPASSES ALL THESE FACTORS BUT DRAWS ATTENTION TO THE GRIEF PROCESS. IT WAS FOUND THAT CHILDREN WERE ABLE TO RESOLVE OBJECT LOSS THROUGH A GRIEF PROCESS WHICH CULMINATED IN AN INVESTMENT IN NEW OBJECT RELATIONSHIPS FOLLOWING FOSTER-HOME PLACEMENT.

AB- CURRENTLY THERE IS MUCH DEBATE ABOUT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF PSYCHOANALYTIC THEORY IN SOCIAL WORK PRACTICE. THE 1:1 APPROACH IS CRITICIZED AS A NARROW AND LIMITED ANSWER TO PRESSING SOCIAL NEEDS. HOWEVER, FREUD'S PSYCHOANALYTIC THEORIES DO NOT SEEK TO ISOLATE MAN TOTALLY FROM SOCIETY BUT RATHER TO VIEW HIM REALISTICALLY AS A BEING HAVING ANTISOCIAL INSTINCTUAL FORCES WITHIN HIM WHICH SOCIAL PLANNING MUST RECOGNIZE AS BOTH AN INDIVIDUAL AND CULTURAL PROBLEM. PSYCHOANALYTIC THEORY IS USEFUL AND NECESSARY TO UNDERSTAND, CLARIFY, AND EFFECTIVELY AID INDIVIDUAL IRRATIONAL AND OFTEN UNCONSCIOUS IMPULSES.

KP- INDIVIDUAL DIAGNOSIS IN GROUP-CENTERED SOCIETYC
SU- Psychodiagnosis; Social Casework; Unconscious (Personality Factor)
AB- RESPONSE TO E. WEISBERGER (SEE 41:8). THE UNDERSTANDING OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR IS IMPOSSIBLE WITHOUT THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE UNCONSCIOUS ASPECTS OF THE HUMAN MIND. OUTWARD DELINQUENT AND SELF-DESTRUCTIVE ACTS ARE SYMPTOMATIC OF AN INNER INABILITY TO FUNCTION IN A REASONABLE MANNER. THEY SHOULD BE EVALUATED IN AN INDIVIDUAL DIAGNOSTIC WAY. THE TROUBLED PERSON MUST BE UNDERSTOOD IN HIS OWN UNIQUE TOTALITY. THERE IS A TENDENCY IN THE CURRENT GROUP-CENTERED SOCIETY TO REFUSE TO SEARCH FOR AND ACCEPT KNOWLEDGE ABOUT ONESELF BY DEPRECIATING THE UNCONSCIOUS PART OF THE MIND RESPONSIBLE FOR BEHAVIOR MOTIVATION. THIS REFUSAL CAN RESULT IN A SENSE OF HELPLESSNESS OVER INABILITY TO CONTROL OURSELVES, IRRESPONSIBILITY, AND A LOSS OF SELF-RESPECT. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- WHETHER CASEWORK CAN BE SPEEDED UP AND INTENSIFIED BY IMMEDIATE SERVICE WAS TESTED OVER A 24-WK PERIOD. 176 INTERVIEWS WERE HELD. 51 FAMILIES WERE SEEN WITHIN 1-4 DAYS OF THE TIME THEY APPLIED. MARITAL AND PARENT-CHILD PROBLEMS WERE MOST PREVALENT. CRISIS INTERVENTION APPEARS TO REACH MORE PEOPLE, PARTICULARLY LOWER INCOME LEVELS, AND TO RESOLVE PROBLEMS IN LESS TIME (6-8 WK) THAN USUAL METHODS. THIS SEEMS RELATED TO PROBLEM-FOCUSED CASEWORK AT A TIME WHEN PEOPLE ARE MORE ACCESSIBLE AND LESS RESISTIVE. FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONNAIRES SENT 12 WK. AFTER THE PROJECT'S COMPLETION INDICATED FAVORABLE RESPONSE TO THIS METHOD. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

THESE GROUPS HELP THE YOUNGSTERS FACE THE DEMANDS AND DISCOVER THE EGO-SUPPORTIVE REWARDS OF PEER GROUP INTERACTION. THEY SHOW THE ALIENATED CHILD THAT HE DOES NOT HAVE TO FEAR EMOTIONAL INTIMACY NOR RESORT TO HIS CHARACTERISTIC FLIGHT FROM IT. THE GROUP WORKER IS AN ACTIVE LEADER WITHIN THE ACTIVITY GROUP, STIMULATING INTERESTS, TEACHING CONCRETE SKILLS, INTERPRETING INDIVIDUAL AND GROUP FEELINGS, AND CONSTANTLY SEEKING IN BOTH WORD AND ACTION TO INDUCE AN APPROPRIATE RESPONSE TO THE INEVITABLE STRESSES OF GROUP INTERACTION.

SU- Psychotherapeutic Transference; Psychotherapy; Reality Testing
AB- Therapeutic success is measured by the increased ability of patients to reality test. The treatment process is effected through interpretation and, more importantly, through manipulation of transference. Various methods wherein transference leads to reality comprehension are explored. Since casework generally can be equated with therapy, the training process of social workers should include some kind of insight-producing transaction; secondly, caseworkers should be allowed to function independently of supervisors more quickly. That means less opportunity for extensive consulation and more time for intensive therapeutic involvement with the patient. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

A team from the Mental Development Center… arranged to screen all patients coming to the pediatrics clinics… ." during a 4-wk period. Out of 726 children, 68 had IQs of 75 or less. Various categories of the mentally retarded group are discussed in terms of their needs, available resources, and services which should be developed to alleviate aggravating conditions in early childhood.

The responses of 53 families who had not applied for institutionalization were compared with those of 20 families who had applied and planned to follow through and with those of 30 families who, despite earlier application, wished to keep their child at home. The "interaction of social, cognitive, experiential, and relational factors was revealed… concerning institutional or home care… . The critical nature of the family's experiences following the child's birth emphasizes the need for early casework counseling and crisis intervention."

The 2nd is long term and chronic and may appear and persist long after the stressful experience. These syndromes and a 7-stage, empirically derived breakdown of the natural history of disasters are presented. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- The essential ingredients of the casework relationship are enumerated as "a true instinct for the greatest of all realities—the reality of personality," absolute trustworthiness, frankness of intercourse, absence of officialism, patience, encouragement, flexibility, persistence. The relationship must vary according to the needs of the client so that along with sympathy and encouragement room is provided for warning and discipline. The term "relationship" denotes a composite of attitudes and values which open the door to the treatment process. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- A special group of mothers, who, because of their feelings of anger and guilt concerning the death of a child, have not been amenable to casework help when they have brought a subsequent problem child to the clinic. These mothers were perceived to have established a masochistic relationship with the current problem child whereby punishment resulted in humiliation and a sense of failure. The individual's unconscious suffering is an attempt on the part of the ego to handle a punishing super-ego. A treatment plan is presented which was successful with 2 such mothers but which needs to be tested further. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

To facilitate assessment of mother and child progress, a questionnaire requesting additional or confirmatory information was sent to 90 homes of previously interviewed families. 76 families replied, 68 giving full information. 20 factors for 53 families were assessed as to opportunity, social environment, and emotional functioning. In 6 of the 7 families where 2 consecutive children were born deaf, 1 or both parents had suffered early deprivation. The best adapted family was "completed" after the birth of the 2nd deaf child, whereas the family with 3 deaf children was a social problem.

To measure the crucial problem area, the author developed the term Verbal Accessibility (VA). A long series of preceding studies are reviewed. The readiness to communicate determinant attitudes, i.e., VA, is seen to be dependent upon the interviewer's skill, motivations, and interaction with his client's characteristics.

AB- If the psychotic and the reactive delinquent—the rare child who steals because he is hungry—are excluded, all delinquency is related to some superego defect, although not to the same degree. Mutual relationships between the 2, and thence between sociology and psychoanalysis should be made. A complete set of barriers interferes and these are suggested and carefully explored. With a few exceptions, adherence to a deviant mode of behavior will be the result of a superego defect, causes lying in the nexus of child-parent relationships and of the dynamic psychology of the individual. Sociological methods can be used to test the hypotheses, but the substance of the propositions will be psychoanalytic. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Behavior labeled as socially deviant (mental illness and delinquency) develops in "a spiraling reverberating sequence of transactions between an individual and his significant others." The role of being "bad" rather than "sick" is often chosen by psychiatric patients and by imprisoned offenders as it seems to offer better possibilities for coping with guilt feelings, punishment, and return to full social status. Destigmatization is necessary for a successful reversal of a deviant career after release from institutions. "Social workers aid people to profit from their deviances, to reverse the deviant career process, to perform within acceptable ranges of behavior, and provide the resources deviants need to achieve such objectives."

The malevolent child reacts with anxiety and aggression to any reactivation of his need for tenderness as it has brought painful experiences in the hostile world which surrounds him. The peer group is thus "the vital road to aiding the child." (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

S's relatives are invited to the clinic during the S's stay to discuss family problems from their own points of view. Purpose: to help relatives "see the connection between the family's emotional climate and the S's strange behavior and neurotic symptoms." Relatives are then encouraged "to think about possible improvements in the family relationships. After their release, patients are invited back along with their relatives to a family psychotherapy group to discuss their views and for a further treatment if necessary.

AB- Primarily exploratory, this study documents the ready identifiability of a child's overt responses to the problem of separation during the diagnostic study. An inverse relationship is noted between the index of a separation problem and the mother's awareness of and concern about separation in her communications to the clinic. Problematic separation behavior appears to be associated with other data to the extent that overt separation behavior in the clinic is not a random event but a meaningful one. Further research in many areas is indicated; many limitations are noted in the findings of this particular study. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

If education for casework is effective, so that latent capacities of the student are challenged, the professional learning experience will be a strong inducement toward personal development. However, the agency supervisor is cautioned to avoid treating the beginning caseworker as a client in therapy. He can best help the student master for professional use the content required for practice by a sustained study of the impact of the education on the student. Thus the education can influence the likelihood that the student will constructively integrate his learning and progress toward professional maturity.

They were individually told the same story describing an imaginary farmer's family and holdings. Multiple choice questions elicited predictions of his life 5 yr. hence relative to the 8 item-areas. Standard area scores were averaged to provide individual protocol scores. The frequency ratio of three levels of aspiration, low, medium and high, was 2:1:1. Departures from this ratio were in the areas of housing and income. Reasons for area differences are explored. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

Nonmembers usually regarded alcoholism as a mental disturbance but most members defined it as "combined mental and physical illness." (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

SU- Adjustment; Attitudes; Human Migration; Parents; Urban Environments
AB- Investigated how forced moving, as part of a 1959 urban renewal project in Topeka, Kansas, affected children and their social networks. It was hypothesized that forced resettlement would have more devastating consequences for children and their families than voluntary moving. Data were collected during the 4 yrs 1961–1964, in 4 yearly interviews with each child concerning topics such as feelings about school, family, friends, moving experience, and aspirations for the future. Interviews with 31 heads of families were also conducted. The following conclusions are discussed: (a) Most children have more negative than positive feelings toward the moving process in forced resettlement, and these negative feelings occur more frequently after the move than before it. (b) Children are less likely than their parents to welcome a forced move. (c) Children who evaluated the moving process negatively are more likely to negatively evaluate their housing, school, and neighborhood after the move than children with positive evaluations of the need for moving. Suggestions are offered concerning the effects of counseling, and the time when it should occur, and the informal counseling services performed by interviewers.

SU- Housing; Nursing Homes; Organizational Structure; Social Change
AB- Discusses the structure and function of homes for the aged. In the past, such homes were characterized by custodial care, hierarchical chain of command, and routinization and standardization of events. Various recent pressures for change are analyzed: changes in characteristics of the elderly, changing values, alternatives to institutionalization, and widespread criticisms of institutions. Homes for the aged in contemporary society have adapted by expanding in size and in the services offered. This expansion is explained by (a) the cultural value of size and growth, (b) allocation of money from funding resources, and (c) reduction in cost per individual treated. Despite expansion, however, the homes of today still maintain the routinization and standardization of events that characterized them in the past, because their larger size and complexity demand bureaucratic structuring. They still do not allow for individual attention to institutionalized people. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

KP- problems associated with 'new towns' movement & social welfare concerns & future development
SU- Communities; Health Care Services; Housing; Social Integration; Urban Planning
AB- Discusses the seriousness of the 1975 collapse of the American "new towns" movement. Examples of new towns are presented that have been funded but are now in serious financial trouble (e.g., Jonathan, Minnesota and Riverton, New York), and the prediction is made that a revival of new towns should occur in the late 1970s. Three major explanations are advanced by developers of new towns for the present difficulties: (a) Housing and Urban Development pressured developers for innovations but did not support innovation research. (b) When progressive developments managed some racial integration, local institutions lessened support. (c) When developers provided social innovations such as prepaid medical group insurance, no other group was willing to help. There are optimistic predictions of revival of new towns, but 75 million new Americans will have to be accommodated by 2000 AD, and the energy crisis will demand self-contained communities; however, the pressure of these new Americans will increase creative community planning. The new town projects are ready to accept these challenges (population, energy, and land scarcity) and will be able to provide innovative solutions once welfare concerns, such as racism and poverty, cease capturing most of the attention of welfare leaders.

KP- social research on housing with emphasis on family & neighborhood
KP- recent trends & issues
KP- US
SU- Environmental Effects; Housing; Neighborhoods; Poverty; Satisfaction
AB- Presents a selective overview of recent trends and directions in social research on housing in the US by focusing on interdisciplinary research emphasizing the family and the neighborhood. The principal research framework is that of physical determinism (assessing the effect of the physical setting on life-styles, attitudes, etc, or designing environments presumed to create desirable social conditions). A brief discussion is presented of the following 4 research emphases: (a) defining neighborhood and territory, (b) poverty and housing, (c) uses of space, and (d) satisfaction with housing. Four conclusions that are common to all research themes are briefly discussed: (a) The principle of physical determinism remains controversial. (b) The key research methods are observation and survey. (c) Housing research is becoming increasingly interdisciplinary. (d) American urban problems and rural nostalgia permeate the research.

KP- cultural variations & psychopathology

SU- Cross Cultural Differences; Husbands; Pregnancy; Symptoms; Syndromes
AB- Examines the major research on the couvade syndrome, here defined as a state in which physical symptoms of psychogenic origin that relate in some way to pregnancy occur in the husbands of pregnant women. The author first discusses cultural variations of the ritual couvade, which involves the participation of the prospective father in the period of rest and recuperation that is physiologically natural for the mother during pregnancy. Research on the couvade syndrome by J. L. Curtis (1955), W. H. Trethowan and M. F. Colon (1965), and others is reviewed, and the psychopathology of the syndrome is examined from both psychodynamic and social crisis viewpoints. It is noted that most individuals with the syndrome do not require treatment; it is suggested, however, that fathers-to-be need more and better preparation for approaching parenthood, and free and easy communication with their wives.

AB- Discusses the Social Welfare Workers Movement (SWWM) by analyzing the Boston chapter, with the New Left theory of social change as the conceptual framework. The theory is first examined and then used to explain the development, structure, goals, activities, and demise of the chapter. It is concluded that the visions of the 1960s are not dead, but the means of promoting them is lacking. Three methods for such advancement in human service professions are suggested: changes in professional education, professional unions, and political alternatives.

AB- Discusses concepts of organizational intervention and assumptions about organizations made by various theories concerning social work practice. 28 references dealing with such theories are analyzed under 4 categories: case work, group work, organizing, and social planning. Each category is considered in its relation to (a) worker involvement, (b) organizational change, (c) types of organizational theory. One of the most promising dialectical theories is that identified with the symbolic interactionist school of sociology. The applicability of this theory is examined.

AB- Discusses protective services for children (the prevention or control of child abuse or neglect) in terms of the general picture of social casework, which is based at present on a philosophy of elitist collectivism. This philosophy supports existing institutions by the very natures of its assumptions. To make casework more human, social workers must participate actively in efforts for change. Treatment of clients must be open, negotiable, teachable, and mutually self-revealing. Both workers and clients must be involved in making policy in social agencies.

AB- Attempts to ascertain the factors associated with an organization's pattern of interorganizational relationships by interviewing personnel of a county board of public assistance (CBA) who were responsible for administering, supervising, or delivering social services. The interview concerned the frequency and purpose of interagency contact. In all, 183 contacts were content analyzed and revealed that CBA personnel had extensive contact with a wide range of agencies but only on a superficial level. These descriptive data also indicated that the primary contacts were with voluntary agencies and primarily for "service," which involved moderate interdependence between agencies. It is concluded that the CBA was a vertically oriented organization with little involvement in other organizations except the parent resource-controlling agency. Suggestions for structural solutions to interorganizational coordination are provided. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

Characteristics of each type are presented, including examples. All 3 types are seen as necessary for efficient and effective evaluation research.

AB- Discusses issues and problems in the area of delinquency prevention. Three views of deviance and how these perspectives influence the definition of delinquency are included. Research methods and the results of 3 types of delinquency prevention are reviewed: (a) programs for improving community life styles; (b) programs for redirecting potential delinquents by working with them before their difficulties become too serious; and (c) programs for reducing recidivism and rehabilitating delinquents, thus preventing further delinquency. Four major problems are discussed (accurate problem identification, reexamination of concepts of intervention, the role played by social control agencies, and the need to weigh the relative contributions of practitioners and researchers) that will affect the future development of prevention programs, and methods of influencing the legislative process are considered.

Groddeck). 16 specific behavioral clues for an impending suicidal attempt and 5 specific techniques of intervention are given. It is believed that sociological and psychological explanations of suicide are quite similar. (17 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

This proposition is supported by examples taken from economic, political, and social theory. (b) Social welfare exchange is a bilateral rather than a unilateral exchange, and as such is no different from other social institutions. Support is provided by a comparison of several views. (c) Perception of new self-interests provides incentives to change to a different policy. A social policy model of education, common domain, and regulatory mechanisms is presented for support. Examples are provided to illustrate the conclusion that newly perceived self-interests are a potential dynamic in egalitarian social welfare policy.

AB- Studied 1,000 students drawn from various fields of study in 3 universities, using random stratified sampling procedures. Each S was administered a 65-item inventory designed to measure 4 aspects of alienation: ego identity, powerlessness, normlessness, and disorganization. It is concluded that alienation in the educational system is all-pervasive and intense, but that there is a growing recognition of student power. Thus a strange situation exists in which alienation and the sense of belonging balance each other. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

Each S was administered the Personal Data Schedule (ordinal birth position, age, sex, education, cultural background, and socioeconomic status) and the Hindi version of the Sentence Completion Test. Female Ss differed significantly in their achievement levels more than did males when tribal Ss were compared with nontribal. Findings suggest that the relationship between birth order and need for achievement is not simple and direct. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Examines an identifiable maladaptive pattern of staff response when a client is seen as a very important person (VIP) in one of the societal institutions: governmental, economic, military, religious, or educational. VIP status is particularly dependent on the client's power in relation to the agency. This problem is most identifiable at time of intake, when normal agency procedures may be circumvented because of the VIP's status. There is often a failure to recognize the client as an individual, with resulting exacerbation of pathology. It is recommended that (a) the VIP phenomenon should be identified at intake, (b) underlying issues of power and status within the agency that may influence treatment of the case should be examined, and (c) normal procedures should be followed in dealing with the client.

SU- Burns; Coping Behavior; Group Discussion; Social Casework; Spouses
AB- Describes rehabilitation treatment of a group of 5 29-45 yr old severely burned patients and their spouses, with the following goals: (a) to develop a mutual support system in which members could share concerns and ways of coping; (b) to give patients at various stages of rehabilitation a time perspective, by exposure to others at different stages; and (c) to learn more about the experiences, perceptions, and coping mechanisms of severely burned patients and their spouses. In the 6 sessions leaders focused on general discussion without interpretations, helping members to see similarities and differences in their reactions to the burn experience. This pilot project indicates that a professionally led group with spouses included facilitates the arduous coping process of recovery by aiding couples to help each other. The group provided mutual support and shared perceptions in terms of family, experiences, and work, as well as providing a safe place for expression of ambivalent feelings and anger. Samples of this group process are given. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Defines 2 groups of patients in general hospitals who require special attention to the social and emotional components of their illnesses: those who experience assaults to self-image and those who must make basic changes in their life-style. These 2 groups comprise a large segment of the adult patient population found in medical and surgical services of the general hospital. The emotional reactions of patients and family members to the process of illness and its treatment by surgery and prescribed regimen are examined. Although therapeutic intervention is the shared responsibility of all health care practitioners, the social worker is particularly equipped to deal with these attitudes and reactions. Methods of social work intervention useful to both groups of patients during hospitalization are discussed. Greater utilization of therapeutic milieu concepts in medical and surgical services is urged, and the role of the social worker in fostering this is identified.

KP- interprofessional team as small group
SU- Group Dynamics; Interdisciplinary Treatment Approach
AB- Maintains that conflicts in interprofessional teamwork may be as much explained by group process considerations as by the interaction of professional roles and statuses. This paper examines the interprofessional team as a small group, using a synthesis of sources from social psychology, social group work, T-group literature, management theory, and health team research. Eight issues are considered in relation to the team as a small group: (a) the individual in the group, (b) team size, (c) group norms, (d) democracy, (e) decision making and conflict resolution, (f) communication and structure, (g) leadership, and (h) group harmony and its relationship to group productivity.

AB- Confusion associated with the developmental problems of adolescence is intensified and prolonged for those suffering from sickle-cell anemia. Feelings of isolation and dependence due to a life-threatening disease can impede the transition to responsible, self-actualizing maturity. Weekly group meetings with 15-24 yr old females suffering from sickle-cell anemia helped them move toward maturation and a sense of their own competence. The experience of closeness with other adolescents who shared the same vulnerabilities was mutually facilitating. Sexual sensations and potential for family life were available counterbalances against recurrent association with pain and death. Through group support these linkages with hope were strengthened.

KP- factors contributing to successful & effective group work
SU- Group Dynamics; Organizational Structure
AB- Discusses the major factors most likely to determine the success of group work. A group is more likely to be successful if it is conducted in an organizational or institutional context in which other personnel, not directly involved with the group, nevertheless accept and support its aims and general procedures and value its potential contribution to the shared goals of the organization or institution. It is more likely to be effective if a consensus (which may be implicit) can be established about its aims and procedures. Lack of clarity, persistent splits within the group, or identification of the leader as adversary all work against the best interests of the group. Structural factors such as size, duration, composition, constancy of membership, and ratio of staff to members influence the group's character and effectiveness. A group which has lost its usefulness can and should be terminated or reconstituted with a different mandate. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)

KP- assertiveness training conducted by social work students

SU- Anxiety; Assertiveness; Social Casework; Social Workers
AB- Students at a school of social work conducted assertiveness training for 5 groups of socially anxious persons from diverse backgrounds. A total of 24 members ranging in age from 16-45 yrs included students, housewives, secretaries, an unemployed white-collar worker, a teacher, a day care supervisor, and a school principal. Treatment methods included modeling, coaching, behavior and covert rehearsal, and contingency contracts; members met weekly for 11/2-2 hrs for 8-10 wks. The major source of data was self-reported descriptions of behavior occurring outside the group. Each member had one or more behaviors that he continually monitered until satisfactory levels were achieved or failure was ascertained. Results show that, of the behaviors targeted for improvement by members, 39 were successfully treated, and 2 were not. Average number of behaviors successfully treated per person was 1.6. It is concluded that this is an effective type of program. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Suggests that ego-directive therapy works primarily to clarify issues on the level of ego and reality and aims at progress in ego development and at client growth in coping and adaptation. The evidence suggests that persons of lower socioeconomic status often expect and resent short-term treatment. However, illustrations abound to indicate that therapy of limited duration has a fairly wide utility, and hence its concepts should be developed and applied across all socioeconomic groups. A case history illustrates short-term therapy and how it differs from a traditional model. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Points out the value of group developmental counseling in a nursery school or day-care center. Because parents are inexperienced when they first have children they are then more receptive. Talking with other parents as well as teachers allows feelings to be expressed that would not emerge in conferences with teachers and school staff only. Groups encourage a parent to seek further help, if needed. This inexpensive, uncomplicated service can educate the parent in child development and provide guidelines for recognizing what behavior is normal, and what is cause for concern.

KP- epidemiological findings & psychogenic factors
KP- sudden infant death syndrome
SU- Epidemiology; Syndromes
AB- Explains the Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) theoretically as a psychogenic phenomenon. Infantile apnea, which has been found to be closely associated with SIDS, is described as maladaptive, regressed behavior occurring in response to tension overload, rather than as a biologic dysfunction. Some of H. S. Sullivan's work is presented to support the concept that infants possess some ability to mediate tension and to respond differentially to environmental changes. Epidemiological findings on SIDS are highlighted, and a pattern is said to emerge which upholds the theory presented. Some of the tensions which might cause the infant to seek to recreate the paradisiacal qualities of the womb are discussed. Comments by 5 critics follow the article, and the authors reply to their criticisms. (30 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

SU- Foster Children; Psychosocial Readjustment; Intellectual Development Disorder
AB- Tested the hypothesis that there are 4 factors that influence the adjustment of a previously institutionalized retardate to a foster home: (a) length of the retardate's stay in an institution before foster-home placement, (b) his home environment before institutionalization, (c) his ability to control his impulses, and (d) his capacity for social communication. A study of 52 female and 20 male placements (ages 1-57 yrs) in foster homes of which only half were successful, showed that only factors (a) and (d) had predictive validity. The implications of these results are discussed. (22 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Administered social distance scales to 659 students at the University of Bombay, who represented 5 religious and 5 linguistic communities. It was found that members of both community types preferred their own groups. Among religious minorities the preferred out-group was the majority religious community, but among the linguistic minorities preferences varied. Social distance scores of religious and linguistic groups revealed similar behavioral tendencies towards certain minority groups. The in-group feelings of religious groups were stronger than those of linguistic groups. Various other specific relationships between in-groups and out-groups are also reported.

AB- Attempted to assess the disparity between occupational preference and value choices of students quantitatively, to determine whether disparity is related to socioeconomic status, and to determine whether such personality variables as extraversion and neuroticism are factors in the disparity. A personality inventory, personal questionnaire, a list of 9 job values, and a list of 26 occupations were administered to 720 pupils. It was found that lower socioeconomic status children and those with parents of lower educational attainment showed greater disparity. There was a greater tendency for disparity among males from families with higher socioeconomic status. In general, neurotic and extraverted Ss showed greater disparity than the others.

AB- Describes some personality and other characteristics of 230 male offenders in London, and relates these variables to recommendations made by probation officers, sentences passed by the courts, and the outcome of penal treatment in terms of further convictions. Probation officers were more likely to recommend probation for introverted neurotics than any other personality type, and once on probation this group was the least likely to be reconvicted. Offenders who were extraverted attracted the largest proportion of recommendations for custodial sentences, and on probation the extraverts who scored low on neuroticism were most likely to be reconvicted. A tentative explanation of the findings is offered in terms of probation "treatment success hierarchy." (20 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)

Results indicate that similarity between counselor and S elicited more favorable relationship-centered judgments, though the condition of dissimilarity led to greater verbal accessibility.

Within a 60-day cut-off period, 60 usable questionnaires were returned. Results reveal that a majority (60.9%) of the respondents approved of the use of body therapy, but less than half (44.9%) approved of the use of sex therapy. A large majority did not report using sex therapy, and only a quarter used body therapy. The importance of reevaluating the profession's theoretical and treatment values and of establishing ethical standards and review procedures is stressed.

It is suggested that an approach may be required which differs in some respects from more traditional modes of treatment. Emphasis is placed upon the need for careful observation of material facts and events in the lives of such clients in addition to careful observation of the manifestations of feelings and attitudes which may give premonition of dangerous or potentially dangerous behavior.

Goffman's world-building theory is used to determine if psychotic patients need brief intervention, recurring crisis intervention, or long-term intervention. The importance of the social work practice of using the patient's capacity to function during remissions as a basis for future expectations is stressed. The chronic patient develops an increasing capacity to cope with his disorder as he matures. Potential hazards of this approach are also noted.

Any useful this of post-treatment integration must enlist the participation of former patients. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

KP- idealization
KP- adolescence
SU- Adolescent Development; Idealism; Personality Development; Personality Processes; Social Perception
AB- Idealization, a regular phenomenon during adolescence, is defined as a process of attributing ideal or perfect characteristics to objects such as movie stars, heterosexual partners, or peer groups. It is utilized adaptively from infancy to latency as the individual seeks narcissistic gratifications. Preoccupied with his own ever-changing body, the adolescent increases role diffusion as his identification with the parental figures lessens. Tension reduction and resolution by methods of the least action are rationales for use of this adaptive process, while the adolescent's intrapsychic environment is in structural upheaval and society is presenting a double-bind situation to the process of identity cohesion. Idealization is an important adaptive skill used by the adolescent in his struggle to gain role autonomy, narcissistic equilibrium, and id-ego balance while reducing dependencies on parental figures. The degree of idealization indicates the degree of life adjustment, and is an important factor for therapists to consider in determining countertransference.

KP- talk time program in university hospital pediatric ward
KP- bedridden children
SU- Hospitals; Social Casework
AB- Discusses a "talk time" program initiated by the departments of nursing and child psychiatry at a university hospital in 1972. The social worker assigned to the inpatient pediatric service became active in the group at the end of its 1st yr and receives backup support from other members of the department. Talk time is held each weekday afternoon for 45 min in a classroom or the room of a bedridden child, and patients are encouraged to and do in fact talk about their fears and fantasies of the hospital experience. Each meeting is followed by a staff session where the proceedings are reviewed. The staff meetings have proved effective in teaching hospital personnel about pediatric patients and in helping them learn how to listen to the children's needs. It is concluded that changes in children are difficult to document, but that, certainly, when a child is allowed to discuss his fears many of his stresses are alleviated.

KP- similarities & differences in 3 residential treatment programs

SU- Juvenile Delinquency; Residential Care Institutions; Treatment Effectiveness Evaluation
AB- Collected data on 3 residential treatment programs for delinquent and delinquency-prone adolescents. Each facility housed 20-50 12-16 yr olds and had on its staff at least one person with a graduate degree in either psychology or social work. Control Ss were used in each of the 3 studies. Similarities and differences in the 3 programs are discussed. One program emerged as more successful than the other 2, and possible reasons for the difference are discussed. Nevertheless, it is concluded that generalized claims concerning the relative effectiveness of residential vs nonresidential forms of correctional treatment are premature.

AB- Conducted interviews with 30 parents who had consulted a children's hospital social service during a 5-mo period but who were no longer clients. 95% described their greatest concerns over their child as anxieties related to diagnosis, surgery, prognosis, and therapeutic regimen following discharge. In exploring their expectations of the social worker, it was found that 46% had not known what to expect and did not remember any conversation with the physician about social services. In recalling what social workers had actually done for them, 50% said they had received emotional support for their anxiety, 43% said they had been helped in finding homemakers, nursing services, and financial assistance. Only 7% did not remember that anything had been done by the social worker. 87% said that, if necessary, they would seek a social worker's help again.

KP- task-centered approach to social casework 1st-yr graduate students
SU- Graduate Students; Social Casework
AB- Constructed an experiment with 16 1st-yr graduate students in social work to determine whether a task-centered approach offers a way to make casework more effective. Each S was assigned 2 cases which were randomly allocated to experimental (A) and control (B) conditions. In A cases, Ss followed guidelines for a set of interventions after developing a behavioral task designed to help reduce some aspect of a target problem he and the client had agreed to work on. In B cases, Ss followed the same procedure but refrained from giving any further assistance to the client in carrying out the task. Results show greater progress for A than for B tasks. 11 pairs of cases showed greater achievement in the A task, 3 pairs were tied, and only 2 had outcomes better for the control tasks. Findings suggest that a sequence of interventions like the one tested may be useful in mobilizing clients to carry out unique or one-time tasks.

KP- social workers
SU- Death and Dying; Hospitalized Patients; Social Casework; Social Workers; Terminally Ill Patients
AB- Proposes that social workers take advantage of the new climate of concern for the dying and reach out to help the hospitalized terminally ill and their families. Social work with the dying is conceptualized in terms of 5 basic categories: planning for living during the terminal process, exploration of feelings about impending death, living with the prospect of death, planning for death, and planning for the family after death. In addition to direct services for and with the patient and his family, value is seen in social work input to the hospital health team, including participation in the training of other staff members interested in increasing their sensitivity toward the dying.

AB- Conducted tape-recorded interviews with 963 applicants for foster children, interviewing husbands and wives separately. 145 couples, accepted as 1st-time foster parents of a 6-12 yr old child, were followed to see how they functioned. The social worker supervising each placement was interviewed at the beginning of the placement and at 6-mo intervals for 18 mos. Interviews with the foster parents were held 1, 3, and 6 mo, and at 6-mo intervals thereafter for up to 18 mo. Results show that no single characteristic of either parent was predictive of success, but when characteristics were combined by multiple correlation, the most promising and least promising applicants applicants be identified. Items considered, as a group, in predicting success were constellation in the home, social worker (time available, experience), foster child (characteristics, history), and characteristics of foster parents.

KP- adaptation of human relations training to social group work
KP- alienation
SU- Alienation; Sensitivity Training; Social Casework
AB- Notes that research on the new group approaches indicates that alienation can be combated through the teaching of empathy. It is posited that the alienated person is cut off not only from the springs of his own creativity but from groups of which he would otherwise be a part. It is felt that the person who fails to achieve a meaningful relationship with others is deprived of some part of himself. Because alienation is judged at base to be a problem in human relations, a framework for adapting the new techniques to social group work is suggested wherein here-and-now feedback is the central process and feelings, cognition, and interaction of the self and other group members are the central content of the experience.

AB- The cooperation of a county welfare department and a city area community mental health center created an alternative delivery of service for the department's clients. The need for this cooperative effort arose when the center decided it could no longer go along with what it considered an archaic medical model that was not delivering services satisfactorily. By establishing a mental health consultation unit within the department to perform Aid for the Disabled (AFD) evaluations and provide general consultation, the 2 agencies aimed to reduce the inconvenience for clients, caseworkers, and mental health professionals and have the basic decision of AFD eligibility made at the site of the problem. Although most of those involved agreed that the undertaking was carried out effectively, and costs were reduced, the program was terminated because of a definition, the qualifications of a mental health practitioner.

Ss were given physical and psychiatric examinations, 2 or 3 psychiatric interviews focused on family dynamics and sociocultural background, and "abreaction with methedrine" for Ss who did not volunteer information. It is concluded that social factors play an important role in the development of peptic ulcers. (19 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

SU- Crises; Divorce
AB- Views the divorce process as a time of emotional crisis with some unique characteristics as well as opportunities for growth. If problem-solving mechanisms are not adequate to return the person to equilibrium, the situation is perceived as a crisis. It can be perceived as a threat, as a loss, or as a challenge. The response will differ in terms of the perception. At some point in the process of divorce, sexual identity and relationships, career choices, role models, and moral and ethical values all come up for reexamination, and the opportunity for further growth is available.

AB- Administered a 42-item questionnaire about attitudes toward women to 274 psychiatrists, residents in psychiatry, psychologists, social workers, and psychiatric nurses in 3 professional settings. Findings support the hypothesis that female therapists tend to have more contemporary attitudes toward women than male therapists but do not support the hypotheses that (a) therapists have attitudes toward women that are more traditional than contemporary or (b) social workers have more contemporary attitudes toward women than other therapists. Psychiatric nurses scored the highest number of contemporary ratings (nonsignificant). 50% of all therapists questioned held a relatively traditional stance, with males obtaining significantly higher traditional scores than women. Respondents in the social service agency showed a higher overall contemporary score than did respondents in the 2 hospitals. Reliability and validity data for the questionnaire are also included.

KP- arguments for & against adoption of black children by white parents
SU- Adoption (Child); Blacks; Parents; Racial and Ethnic Attitudes; Whites
AB- Discusses the controversy about the transracial adoption of Black children by White parents. The argument for transracial adoption appears to be based on 2 reasons: that the Black community cannot provide the needed Black adoptive parents and that raising Black children in a White home will be better than raising them in an institution or foster home. The limitations of current data on the adoption rates of Blacks by Blacks are examined, and it is suggested that the benefits of adopting a Black child at a younger age by White parents do not necessarily outweigh the disadvantages of later adoptive failures. The issue of right of choice is also discussed, and it is noted that no Black consensus has been reached on the question of Black adoption. The psychosexual needs of the child are discussed in relation to whether transracial adoption would fulfill both the child's present and future needs. It is concluded that (a) transracial adoption may harm the Black child in that he may lose his sense of Black identity and the ability to relate to other Blacks and (b) until empirical studies are made of the adult personalities of White-raised Blacks, placements of Black children should not proceed as though transracial adoption had already been found to be beneficial.

KP- exclusive vs inclusive fostering considerations for placement
KP- social work
KP- criticism of British Children Bill
SU- Foster Children; Foster Parents; Social Casework
AB- Argues that more types of children are now being assessed as requiring fostering at a time when social service departments are finding it difficult to expand their number of foster homes. This greater demand for foster homes coincides with recent studies which help to clarify the nature of fostering. Accordingly, a distinction can be made between "exclusive" and "inclusive" fosterings. It is pointed out that a conflict exists between popularity of exclusive fostering and research findings which stress the value of inclusive fostering. Research is also identifying the contribution which social workers can make in the fostering field. However, the desired inputs of training, low caseloads, and staff stability pose problems for social work management. The research findings discussed in the paper are used to argue that the forthcoming British Children Bill is not only based on false assumptions about the behavior of natural parents but will also promote exclusive rather than inclusive fosterings. It is also argued that child welfare policy should be seen in a larger context of social reform. (43 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)

The team takes the view that child abuse is a social ill, the roots of which often stem from an unhealthy environment within the family of the victim. The team is composed of 2 full-time community aides, a half-time nurse, a consulting pediatrician, a consulting psychiatrist, and a full-time social worker. During the past 2 yrs, the team has served more than 30 families. Case illustrations are cited. A goal for each family is the definition and clarification of problems that can be dealt with in the family's future contacts with team members.

KP- previous work experience

KP- social work graduate students
SU- Anxiety; Graduate Students; Self Concept; Social Work Education; Social Workers
AB- Examined the impact of previous work experience on the manifest anxiety level and self-concept of 49 US graduate social work students. Data were gathered using the Taylor Manifest Anxiety scale and the Tennessee Self Concept Scale. Contrary to the hypothesis, prior work experience did not act as an inhibitor of anxiety nor as a support to self-concept. No significant difference on test scores was found between Ss with work experience and those with no work experience. Manifest anxiety levels and self-concept scores of Ss in either category were not different from those found in other occupational populations. It is tentatively suggested that social work students may not have higher anxiety levels as some of the literature has indicated. It may be that the anxiety social work educators see in students in the field is quite within normal limits, that it does not threaten students' self-concepts, and that it does not inhibit learning.

AB- Reviews a range of formulations about the Chicano family drawn from the literature. Attention is given to the conceptions of ideal family models used as criteria for studying Chicanos. It is suggested that a re-examination of ideal family forms may benefit from the Chicano family experience. The main strength of the Chicano family is in its stress on human relationships and its sense of community, which to a great extent are not emphasized within the larger American structure. To develop an appreciative viewpoint from which to view the Chicano family would appear to require a reappraisal of the values of the wider society.

AB- Presents case material to demonstrate the usefulness of R. M. Foster's approach to family intervention. Rationalizations often used by parents to explain their children's behavior are pointed out, as are the pseudodemands parents make on their children as a consequence of these rationalizations. Ways to therapeutically intervene are suggested. Emphasis is on changing behavior. Frequent past objections to Foster's technique made by professionals are discussed in an attempt to further clarify the technique. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

KP- milieu therapy program
KP- hospital stay & discharge & adjustment to community
KP- chronic patients in state hospital
SU- Hospital Discharge; Psychiatric Hospitalization; Psychiatric Patients; Psychosocial Readjustment; Therapeutic Community
AB- Conducted a milieu therapy program with 2 groups of chronic patients in a state hospital with the goals of shortening their stays, discharging them into the community, and helping them adjust to the community. In groups of 10-13, patients were encouraged to solve their own problems, rely less on attendants, and realistically expect discharge. Life was constructed in the hospital setting in a way that made "getting out" the central issue for all patients. Group I originated with 54 female patients who were classified by the attendant staff as the most recalcitrant to rehabilitation. When a patient was discharged from the group, she was immediately replaced with another chronic patient. During the first 16 mo, of 75 patients, 50 were discharged to convalescent leave, 11 to family care, 3 were directly discharged, and 11 were transferred to another building. In Group II, with 58 younger female patients, results were similar. It is concluded that milieu therapy holds substantial promise for overcoming social disabilities commonly associated with mental illness. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

KP- classical psychoanalytic theory of feminine psychology
KP- client-therapist relationship in psychotherapy & therapist's sex role bias
SU- Human Females; Psychoanalytic Theory; Psychotherapeutic Processes; Stereotyped Attitudes; Womens Liberation Movement
AB- Presents the theories of feminine psychology as found in the paradigms of Freudianism, neo-Freudianism, and learning theory, and sets forth the implications of such ideology for the client-therapist relationship. The classical psychoanalytic theory is seen as viewing woman's condition as passive and receptive, as ordained by her anatomy which naturally develops passive tendencies in social roles. The male is seen as dominant, endowed as he is with a penis. The female's psychologically normal role, as the anatomical receptor, is seen as that of wife and mother, dependent on the male, submissive. Male characteristics are positive, female characteristics negative. To help her overcome this negative self-image, often perpetuated by the therapist, therapy in a consciousness-raising group is recommended for the female client. Central to the ideology of such groups is the belief that the individual, the social structure, and the culture are interrelated. For the therapists-who often unconsiously impose classical attitudes on their clients-sensitivity training is suggested to help them evaluate and remedy personal sex-role bias.

Findings support the hypothesis that most Ss belong to Classes 3 and 4 of a 5-point scale of social class; mostly support the hypothesis that heredity is a significant factor; partially support the hypothesis that the difference in the types and multiplicity of stress corresponds to the severity of mental illness; partially support the hypothesis that broken homes, birth order, prolonged puberty stress, etc, are important factors in the background of Ss; and fail to support the hypothesis that the adjustment of Ss to their socioeconomic surroundings is poor.

It is concluded that the scales put the responsibility for the outcome of treatment on the worker rather than the client, and that this can be draining, but that the scales are important to the evaluation and training of students and to the obtaining of positive results from therapy.

AB- Reports the emotional reactions of staff members to abortion work, some factors that influenced these reactions, and whether intellectual attitudes toward abortion were related to emotional response. A self-administered questionnaire concerning personal characteristics, attitude toward abortion, and emotional reaction to abortion work was distributed to 66 doctors, nurses, and social workers at 2 eastern teaching hospitals. Response rate was 63.6%. This study found that negative emotional reactions or discomfort arising from personal involvement in abortion work correlated highly with profession, type of patient care given, and contact with the aborted fetus. Correlations existed (a) between negative reaction and religion, (b) between negative reaction and the ability to personally choose to do abortion work, (c) between discomfort with abortion work and abortion law preference, and (d) between discomfort and the method of abortion.

AB- Considers the possibility that soap operas, watched by 35-40 million women, may be an example of myth and a route to the collective unconscious. Myths are catalytic in the continual reworking of internal conflicts and identities. An individual can actually assume only a given number of roles at any 1 time, but through imagination and role-playing he may try on persona from all stages of life. Soap operas are described as helping the individual to try on his multiplicity of roles and rework his singular and group identities. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

Changes in public attitude and official policy and in the administration of the welfare system have seriously affected the services available. There has been a notable increase in cases closed by the New York City Department of Social Services as "ineligible." Because of senility, infirmity, mental illness, retardation, and the like, many elderly clients are incapable of completing the required forms and thus are unable to obtain assistance. Among the hundreds of young people who come to the attention of the Society, problems of mental illness, addiction, unwanted pregnancies, unemployment, family conflicts, and loneliness reflect a time of social flux.

There is the imminent possibility of court cases to test the legality of the present policies. It is suggested that adoption agencies must begin to re-evaluate their position in regard to sealed records. The present standards of anonymity were developed as a safeguard for all those people involved in adoption; however, a study is described which indicates that for many persons these standards have been the cause of insoluble problems. It is concluded that the role of the agency as intermediary among adoptee, natural parents, and adoptive parents should be considered in a new creative way.

The issues of continuity and multiple parenting are tested against available empirical evidence. It is suggested that legal recommendations drawn from psychoanalytic theory may warrant re-evaluation, and that the best interests of the child are not deducible from theory.

AB- Evaluated the extent to which program planning affects the behavior of antisocial children, with 8-16 yr old anti- and prosocial boys as Ss. 8 categories of activities were measured-verbal activity, "it" games, team sports, free swimming, arts and crafts, special events, transitional activity, and written tasks. Those activities that tended to decrease antisocial and nonsocial behavior and those that tended to increase the incidence of prosocial behavior are described. Results show that program planning is a pertinent variable in controlling the behavior of antisocial children. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

SU- Demographic Characteristics; Human Females; Prisoners
AB- The percentage increase in women convicts between 1962 and 1965 was over 4 times the male prisoners. A study of these women indicates that women prisoners should be regarded as a distinctive group deserving specialized attention. A strong effort is called for to "stem the surging crime rate among women." Demographic data showed areas of the country where the female crime rate was highest. The relatively short stay of women in prison (only 5% stay more than 6 mo) raises problems regarding effective rehabilitation during the prison term. There is a discussion of the need to prevent criminal behavior, both before a woman becomes an offender and in the immediate postrelease period.

AB- Reviews the literature and current approaches to treatment of lesbians, and presents preliminary findings of a study based on a nonclinical sample of 51 Ss. The life-styles of the Ss, their problems, views of themselves, relationships with others, and their perceptions of society's reactions to them are explored. Findings indicate that lesbians all too often find the helping professions, as well as a number of American institutions, to be judgmental and nonsupportive of them. This is attributed, at least in part, to the dearth of practical and theoretical literature concerning the female homosexual. (24 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

KP- social worker & client perspectives of meetings
KP- outcomes of social work treatment
SU- Psychotherapeutic Processes; Social Casework
AB- Describes how social worker and client perspectives on various aspects of their meetings are related to one or all of several outcomes of treatment (e.g., failure to give a service, failure to perceive the social worker's role, or the failure to continue to seek help). The author's experiences with 8 sets of clients are described to illustrate how the outcome in each case is a reflection of each party's interpretations of crucial aspects of the meetings. Although this may reflect a 1-sided picture of the practice of social work, it is argued that it also emphasizes the process in which past and present circumstances affect both parties' perspectives of the therapeutic contact and how these circumstances increase the probability that the clients will either fail to obtain help or regard their meetings with social workers as no different from other passing contacts with "officials" who feature in their lives.

KP- parental childrearing methods

SU- Childrearing Practices; Juvenile Delinquency; Poverty; Poverty Areas; Social Values
AB- Considers that middle-class child-centered behavior, as defined by J. Newson and E. Newson, is not operable in the milieu of poverty. Recent studies completed in England are cited which show that material shortages in the home and poor environmental conditions greatly affect parental child-rearing methods. An alternative model of child-centeredness applicable to the culture of poverty is proposed, and a group of families who share a relatively happy home atmosphere and enjoy participating in children's activities is identified, although it is pointed out that this type of family does not always prevent delinquency. Effective methods of delinquency prevention are shown not to be related to family cohesiveness. It is suggested that the current controversy over preparations for parenthood should acknowledge the realities of slum life which force parents to use child-rearing methods they in fact do not approve of. A more appropriate population for education in parenthood would be a socially upwardly mobile one. It is concluded that parents and children in the slums need vast financial resources to improve their conditions before an attempt is made to change their attitudes.

AB- Suggests, on the basis of recent war experiences in Israel, that parental fear reactions are especially traumatic for the small child when the parents try to protect him by denying the facts of war. Illustrations are cited which show that small children react to unexplained and hidden stress in their environment with distress. Children notice and can be helped to comprehend events that affect their lives. When an adult is able to act as mediator and interpreter of stressful events, the child's anxiety lessens and both adult and child find a new source of comfort and strength in each other.

AB- Views role enactment as a basic concept of intervention theory, encompassing all the verbal aspects of any therapy system. Environmental manipulation, behavior modification, moral exhortation, cognitive techniques, suggestion and autosuggestion, and ways in which these techniques relate to role enactment are discussed. Whether the self selects a role, or the role forms the self, role enactment produces changes in perception, opinion, and behavior. The extent to which these changes are temporary or long lasting has not yet been determined. Nevertheless, empirical evidence supports the conclusion that role enactment is a means of producing changes in behavior. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

SU- Counseling; Family Therapy; Group Psychotherapy; Parent Child Relations; Psychotherapeutic Techniques
AB- Investigated the treatment of parents in group psychotherapy at a child guidance clinic as seen by the parents and the group therapists. The 2 major schools of thought regarding the approach to parents' groups are contrasted; one emphasizes ego-oriented guidance, the other stresses the development of insight leading to deeper personality change. Parents and therapists evaluated treatment differently as to the importance of the group as family analogy and as to what constituted therapeutic gain. The study points to the need for more effective communication between group leaders and group members. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Conducted a follow-up study of the usefulness of psychiatric evaluations and of how psychiatric diagnoses and recommendations, based upon categories of ego functioning, had predicted recidivism among 88 "assaultive boys" in the year after the evaluations. Major findings were that psychiatric evaluations did not appear to be useful in identifying dangerous juveniles or in predicting recidivism. Nonclinical variables were also examined and appeared to be better predictors of assaultive behaviors. Findings point to the need for a psychosocial approach in prediction and treatment.

AB- Used Maslow's need-hierarchy model to assess perceptual differences in need-gratification and need importance. Ss were 50 workers who participated in the organization, 50 who did not, and 28 foremen and 17 assistant foremen in different plants. Those who participated placed physiological needs above autonomy; the reverse was true for those who did not participate. Foremen and assistant foremen placed autonomy over self-actualization and employees at the 3 levels of organization had significantly different physiological needs. Gratification of higher-order needs remained important to all employees after their lower-order needs were marginally satisfied. Difference in income led to variations of perceptual gap in the gratification of physiological needs but not of autonomy and self-actualization. The implications of these findings are discussed.

AB- Violent student agitation in India has affected practically all universities. Students' opinions about one form of violence was examined by asking them how they felt about the use of unfair means in university examinations. They were requested to state (a) their reactions in terms of perceptions and values, (b) their thoughts as to the reasons for the behavior, and (c) their suggestions for stopping the practice. 100 replies were analyzed. The main finding was that blame for what is happening on campus cannot be given entirely or primarily to students. Responsibility also falls on teachers, university officials, parents, and the present societal structure. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

A maximum 6-wk treatment period can effect change while families are motivated to resolve problems. Early, realistic goal-setting sharpens worker performance and supports family reintegration. The approach can reach clients who otherwise might be frustrated by longer, more traditional intake procedures. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

KP- medical & psychological & social aspects of vasectomy
KP- social work practice implications
SU- Social Casework; Vasectomy
AB- Discusses medical, psychological, and social aspects of vasectomy. The medical procedure is relatively simple but a later reversal is difficult. Psychological aspects are important both in motivation and aftereffects. Vasectomy does not seem to be useful in treating frigidity, impotence, or premature ejaculation. Infidelity, divorce, and separation are likewise unaffected by the operation. Men do not appear pressured into the procedure. Public attitudes have steadily become more accepting of this birth-control method, but professionals now caution against its unadvised use. Implications for social workers include program planning and development, education, and pre- and postcounseling. Professionally prepared workers are important in providing quality services.

AB- Discusses the concept that excessive drinking may be a symptom of a person's faulty interaction with his family and significant others. Studies using this social systems approach (i.e., in which the family is regarded as the basic unit for treatment) are evaluated. Data suggest that (a) rehabilitation workers who viewed alcoholism as an illness did not have as great a success in working with alcoholic patients as did workers who held interaction orientations and (b) group counseling may be more effective than individual counseling in decreasing drinking. The need for further study of this explicit interactional approach toward alcoholism is emphasized, and the limitations of individualistic and illness-oriented models of alcoholism are noted.

The multifaceted approach uses techniques of relationship, nurture, mobilization, and limited clarification in reaching goals of ego-conservation or restoration. Hostility, denial, and transference are frequent elements in the long and often painful relationship, challenging the skills and understanding of the therapist; his acceptance of the alcoholic as treatable is essential for success.

After discharge, outpatient visits utilize similar techniques for as long as a year, and appear to be essential to sustained treatment gains. Treatment methods undergo constant evaluation, and a 2-yr period is projected as necessary to validate the approach. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

KP- Yugoslavia
KP- implications for community mental health centers in US
SU- Community Involvement; Community Mental Health Centers; Participation; Social Processes
AB- Describes the Yugoslavian experience in developing citizen participation and discusses its implications for community mental health centers in the US. The entire social, political, and economic system of Yugoslavia is built on the principle of citizen participation at all levels and self-management of decentralized communes. In the 1950's social welfare programs were separated from public administration and replaced with a single political authority with a team of mental health professionals, educators, and lawyers. The republic law sets program standards (e.g., professional qualifications), but citizens at the local level determine the programs they want to be implemented. The role of the professional is to advise, motivate, and stimulate the citizens, but not to formulate policy. It is suggested that at the inception, US community mental health centers should have applied some of these principles, particularly those of community involvement, professional advisors, and programs which reflect the diversity of the nation's catchment areas rather than the uniform definition of service by professionals. The Yugoslavian experience suggests that the thrust for self-identity and recognition by various ethnic groups in the US could be effectively met through meaningful citizen participation in decentralized social service organizations.

AB- Surveyed articles published for the past 8 yrs in Social Work to determine the way in which authors treated the sex-role factor when studying social workers and their clients. Analysis shows that the issue is largely ignored; the sex of the therapist is rarely mentioned. It is argued that knowledge of the sex of the worker affects research outcome, particularly with special client groups (e.g., delinquents) where sex-role identification is a major issue. The relationships between sex and race of therapist and client are discussed. It is concluded that social workers would understand themselves and their clients better if research on the importance of race, ethnicity, and class were integrated with the effects of sex.

AB- Studied a university counseling center for women to determine better their needs and the types of services that would help them. Data on clinical status, demographic variables, and services used are reported for 46 clients. Case histories of 18 clients exhibiting moderate to severe depression during the initial interview are presented. It was found that most conflicts centered around career development and employment, enforced mobility caused by frequent relocation of the husband's job, and emotional conflicts over traditional vs nontraditional sex roles. Most clients showed an alleviation in symptoms within 4 mo. A 4-mo follow-up of the depressed client subgroup indicated general clinical improvement and greater social adjustment, as measured by effective participation in work or school. It is concluded that female high school students should be counseled concerning the advantages of combining roles and making long-term career plans.

AB- Conducted a study at a state hospital to determine the quantitative influence that counselors have on problems related to alcohol and drugs. Patients admitted from 7 counties which employed full-time drug and alcohol counselors (N = 6) were compared with patients from 10 counties without counselors. Counselors were mostly ex-alcoholic paraprofessionals. The counselors were found to have a significant impact. Counseled patients had higher admission rates, shorter length of stay in the hospital, longer length of time back in the community, and lower rates of readmission.

SU- Behavior Modification; Clinical Methods Training; Lower Class; Middle Class; Parents
AB- Describes a training program designed to help parents modify problem behaviors in their 10-mo-old to 6-yr-old children. 29 welfare and 29 middle-class families participated in welfare only, middle-class only, or mixed groups. The major tasks of the parents were to read assignments on behavior modification techniques, monitor their child's behaviors weekly, apply change procedures, and develop treatment plans independently. Parents chose the behaviors they wished to modify. The most frequent treatment procedure used by parents was primary reinforcement coupled with enthusiastic praise. Weekly group meetings were held to prepare for home assignments and provide feedback concerning the accomplishments of the past week. It was found that while outcome was successful for the majority of participants, the greatest success was obtained in the mixed group. The major difference between the 2 class groups as a whole was that it took the welfare parents longer to develop adequate monitoring and treatment plans. Class differences in the target behaviors selected were also observed. It is concluded that welfare parents who are grouped with middle-class parents are more motivated to child behavioral change, and that welfare mothers can successfully utilize behavior modification procedures with their children.

Aims were to offer in-home rehabilitation, counseling, and guidance service to families with problems in child-rearing; to train adult paraprofessionals as parent-aides in family living and child-rearing with expertise in working with families within their home settings; to test the feasibility of group meetings for sharing problems; and to offer an alternative to hospitalization. 17 families were served. Aides spent 65% of their time in direct contact with 20% devoted to telephone contacts. Parents reported marked differences in their living situations as a result of the help provided by the parent-aides. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Describes a behavior therapy program conducted with 36 chronic psychiatric inpatients on a locked hospital ward. After baseline data on the kind and frequency of maladaptive or disruptive behaviors were obtained, Ss were given in-hospital work and a list of the progressive steps through which they could obtain discharge. Staff cooperation was elicited through the use of behavior therapy seminars which outlined program goals and implementation. Results indicate a reduction in specific disruptive behavior. It is suggested that the outcome was successful because the consequences of inappropriate behaviors were clearly specified and consistently applied, appropriate behavior was reinforced, and patients had less unstructured time that might encourage maladaptive behavior.

AB- Studied the occurrence of nonverbal courting behaviors between patient and therapist as similarly found in American courtship (a concept advanced by Scheflen as quasi-courting). A series of interviews from a convenience sample were observed and instances of quasi-courting noted. 26 interviews in an adult clinic showed no instances of the behavior. 21 of 36 interviews in an aftercare unit did show occurrences. Therapists using quasi-courting were unexpectedly found familiar with it as a therapeutic technique. It is concluded that the behavior occurs with differential frequency related to settings and individuals. Possible uses and misuses are noted.

AB- Discusses elements of seductive behavior and difficulties in management, especially for learners. A review of the literature shows that while casework psychotherapy does not promote transference as does analysis, it more often deals with transference-prone clients. Therapeutic management of seductive behavior becomes a sensitive and difficult task. Given a questionnaire, the author's classmates narratively described an encounter. Almost 1/2 of 28 responses mentioned feelings of anxiety; 10 noted annoyance or anger; 22 contained some degree of diagnostic appraisal. Management efforts ranged from ignoring through confrontation, depending on the type of behavior and student worker. Seductive behavior is concluded to occur often, possibly causing discomfort as a threat to the professional role. Analytic understanding dissipates discomfort and supports professional effectiveness.

SU- Family Relations; Lead Poisoning; Recidivism
AB- To study the importance of family dynamics and social environment on lead poisoning in children, hospital records of 10 single-ingestor cases and 10 recidivist lead poisoning cases were compared. No significant differences were found in demographic data; both groups had socioeconomic characteristics associated with poverty. In terms of family diagnoses, single-ingestor families tended to be inadequate whereas recidivist families were unsocial and exhibited more severe pathology. Most families were below normal on all areas of family functioning (e.g., marital relationships and child-rearing practices). In all of the unsocial families and in 4 of the inadequate families the child continued to ingest foreign substances. Inadequate families followed directions for their child's treatment more than recidivist families, who exhibited aggressive resistance to treatment. It is concluded that family type is a significant variable in both the onset and recidivism of lead poisoning, and that family and social therapy is as important as medical procedures in treating the disease.

AB- Studied effects of patient's sex on the clinical judgment of 67 social workers, psychologists, and psychiatrists. Clinicians were asked to make judgments about 1 of 2 randomly distributed forms of a pretested case analog where every variable except the sex of the patient was held constant. Impressions were collected on a structured questionnaire. Group means were computed and descriptively small but statistically significant differences were found. The female patient was more frequently judged as healthier and despite agreement that passivity was the major problem, it was less often seen as the treatment focus for the male. Therapists anticipated more interfering countertransference would exist with the male. An unexpected finding was that social workers more frequently recommended supportive treatment for the female and interpretive, insight-oriented treatment for the male. Evidence of a double standard of mental health was observed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

Covert relationship messages occurred in supervisory conferences. Incongruence was associated with relationship strain. In sample pairs which achieved accommodation in spite of disagreements in role stance at the outset, both parties compromised. Smooth relationships were likely for pairs which were matched in role stance. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

SU- Professional Ethics
AB- An examination of the codes of ethics of 89 human service occupational groups indicates that ethical principles can be classified into 4 categories reflecting the practitioner's personal characteristics and his relationships with clients, professional colleagues, and society. The codes stress that the practitioner should exhibit competence, impartiality, and integrity. In terms of relationships with clients, the practitioner should show objectivity, honesty, devotion, and confidentiality. Ethical principles among professional colleagues relate to etiquette, fairness, and maintenance of professional orientation. On the societal level, practitioners should take care in the use of personal status and should be concerned about social problems and the overall welfare of society. An evaluation of the Code of Ethics of the National Association of Social Workers indicates that it provides only a small portion of these ethical principles and lacks a clear system of implementation and enforcement.

KP- attitude towards self during adulthood stage of 25-35 yrs
KP- psychiatric residents & child fellows & social workers
SU- Developmental Stages; Psychiatric Training; Self Perception; Social Workers
AB- Studied ages 25-35 as a phase of adulthood. 30 psychiatric residents, child fellows, and social workers were asked how it felt to be their specific age. If appropriate, each was asked how it had felt at 25 and how it might feel at 35. Summaries were grouped by age and a content analysis was performed. Other analyses were done by regrouping of marital status, sex of S, parental status, and discipline. 4 features emerged from this time span: (a) descriptions of self changed; (b) respondents noted pressure to reach closure on personal issues within a limited time; (c) shifts in self-descriptions could be grouped in 3 related stages resulting from aging and its interactional effects with marriage, parenthood, career; and (d) 31-35 yr olds and others who were parents described themselves in terms consonant with E. Erikson's concept of generativity vs stagnation. Early adulthood is concluded to be a distinct phase. Tasks and new capacities are outlined.

KP- institutional racism in social & economic & political systems
KP- US
SU- Political Economic Systems; Racism; Social Processes
AB- Discusses operating policies in the US which serve to oppress individuals or groups through sanctioning inequality in status, access to goods and services, and different priorities for blacks and whites. It is argued that this institutional racism is deeply rooted in the social, economic, and political systems and that such racism may be covert (e.g., when college administrators use IQ tests as admission criteria). Institutional racism is considered to be particularly evident in the housing industry, e.g., when the federal government decided to subsidize a white exodus into suburbia rather than rebuild the cities and then allowed counties to pass ordinances prohibiting low income housing outside the cities. It is suggested that to combat institutional racism, blacks must be significant participants in decision-making regarding matters relating to the welfare of blacks and that programs should be developed which increase the power base and prestige of blacks.

Families can also be helped by the caseworker to cope with the members' ambivalent feelings about the patient while helping the patient to clarify his feelings and maintain a sense of self-worth and dignity.

AB- Describes the use of methods derived from social learning theory and some techniques of behavior modification as treatment for child abusers. The program was located in a predominantly black neighborhood and was staffed primarily by 4 female black family health workers, 3 full-time social workers, and a black registered nurse. The program encompasses 5 basic steps: (a) identify the cause of injury; (b) conduct a precise behavioral analysis of the parent's child management techniques; (c) decide whether the child can be returned to the family if the program provides continued assistance; (d) formulate plans for treatment; and (e) introduce the family to the staff, usually when the child leaves the hospital. Treatment involves using specific procedures for certain problem areas in parent-child relationships, establishing a continuity of service between the child's hospitalization and the parent's treatment, and evaluating behavioral changes. Problems and limitations of the program are briefly noted. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Studied the families of 18 agoraphobes. On the basis of interviews with the patients, who were undergoing treatment by extensive exposure, families were assigned to 1 of 3 groups: "well-adjusted families," "anxious-patients families," and "sick families." 6 of the 7 patients from "well-adjusted" families showed significant improvement, maintained over a 1-yr follow-up period. At a follow-up of 3 mo none of the other patients had improved. At a 1-yr follow-up 1 "anxious" patient had entered the significantly improved category with additional help and 3 showed a trend toward improvement. Of the patients from "sick families" 1 eventually showed a trend toward improvement. Possible associations between family adjustment and the agoraphobe's chances of recovery are discussed.

SU- Family Relations; Male Delinquency
AB- Compared the family circumstances of 222 nondelinquent 11-14 yr old boys from a random sample of working-class families with those of 246 boys of the same age in court for the first time. Two-thirds of the officially delinquent boys came from ordinary families, intact and without serious problems. However, they were significantly more likely than the nondelinquents to come from broken homes or unbroken (intact) homes with serious and persistent problems. The differences were not due to neighborhood or school factors, which appear to a considerable extent to operate independently of family factors. Few first court appearances were explained by boys reacting to serious family stress. Follow-up of the delinquents over 2 yrs showed that approximately 25% of the boys from ordinary families became persistent offenders and approximately 33% of those from difficult family circumstances reappeared. Findings are discussed in the light of other research and current social work practice. (51 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Considers that the professional social worker in the field of drug abuse may find his personal beliefs in conflict with his professional responsibilities. 3 distinct roles of the social worker are outlined: practitioner, expert, and intellectual. The tensions which may arise in each role when working in the field of drug addiction or with specific drug users are discussed, and the influences of professional codes of ethics and legal considerations are examined.

SU- Coping Behavior; Emotional Adjustment; Eysenck Personality Inventory; Neuroticism; Sensitivity Training
AB- Assessed the psychologically disturbing effects of 1 wk of sensitivity training, using 2 measures of disturbance: the Neuroticism scale of the Eysenck Personality Inventory (EPI) and a behavior change questionnaire completed by the 30 participants and 70 friends and close family members. Ss showed increased neuroticism on the EPI as a result of training, but this was not confirmed by Ss' family and friends 2 wks later (the most likely period of disturbance from training). Many trainees saw themselves and were seen by family and friends as slightly better able to cope with personal and family problems, better able to communicate and to get along with children and significant persons, and happier. Possible reasons for different results from the 2 measures are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Suggests that despite good intentions and special projects, education is critically affected by lack of knowledge and appreciation of different cultural patterns. Most reparatory approaches developed by schools to deal with problems of Puerto Rican children turn out to be unsystematic and fragmentary. Little is done to help these forces converge in positive ways. It is suggested that the problems of the city and its community are not being handled. Changes require more than a blend of competent staff, nonfragmentary planning, and benevolent purposes; they require organizing in areas about which information is still unformed.

The Puerto Rican family is, in contrast to the American, an extended family; intimate relationships with the kinship system are of high value and a source of pride and security. Relationships are intense and frequent, even if the persons are not living in the same household. In this patriarchal family, roles are clearly defined and strictly monitored. The elderly are respected and the young are dearly loved. The Puerto Rican family, however, encompasses not only those related by blood and marriage, but also those tied to it through custom.

SU- Behavior Modification; Psychoanalysis
AB- Uses a case report to (a) point out the strengths of behavior modification techniques as a tool in helping clients, and (b) stimulate practitioners into thinking of alternative techniques when traditional methods have failed to produce desired results. Use of a time-out procedure with positive and negative reinforcements produced improved behavior in a 7-yr-old boy. It is suggested that failure to respond to therapy is often seen solely in terms of resistance on the part of clients rather than as the result of the inappropriateness and ineffectiveness of the therapeutic intervention. Behavior modification is only one new tool to be considered as an alternative to traditional psychoanalytic treatment. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

KP- mature women
SU- Human Services; Social Work Education
AB- Describes various solutions that administrators find practical in the training of mature, caring women to use their life experiences in human services. One year's full-time training which includes academic and fieldwork learning is felt to be sufficient. An evaluation of the program during its 2nd yr has shown it to be highly successful from the perspectives of both students and employers. Graduates do not compete with holders of the MSW degree but fill positions that would otherwise be held either by untrained personnel or college graduates. Employers recognize the impressive strengths that result from a combination of maturity and skill training. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Social expectations influence social developments. Thus, when soldiers considered unlikely to adjust to army life were treated like other soldiers, 75% of the poor prospects adjusted well. Similarly, if a therapist, in an effort to be objective, feels a patient unlikely to profit from therapy, this very attitude can contribute to therapeutic failure; the converse is true when a therapist is optimistic.

KP- MILIEU AS A FACTOR IN
AB- What is the effect of the milieu as distinguished from individual psychotherapy in the total treatment of emotionally disturbed or delinquent children? The cases of 3 boys who were residents at the Hawthorne Cedar Knolls School are presented. Generalizing from these and other similar cases it is suggested that the therapeutic environment alone may accomplish the task where (1) the task is one of ego development rather than the correction of fairly crystalized personality problems, and (2) in those rare instances in which the child's personality disorder is a reaction response to placement at a fairly young age.

AB- The partition of India has produced great social change. A program of research is urgently needed to understand this metamorphosis. 6 areas are suggested as crucial in such a program: stereotypes and social myths, implications of growing industrialism, social changes due to migration of families, analysis of intergroup attitudes toward values and beliefs, variables leading to higher incidence of criminal behavior, and the psychological reactions of both local and incoming groups. Objective investigation of inner activity, especially the "world of meaning," is stressed as vital to understanding external behavior. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- The case of a 21-year-old man, severly handicapped from birth by spaciticity due to cerebral palsy, is used to indicate that an effective rehabilitative program demands a "total push" effort and that such an effort requires close and purposeful collaboration of multidiscipline personnel in both the intramural settling and in the community. The rehabilitative program extending over a period of 4 years shows the vital need for coordination of team activities and the fact that the specific leadership of the team may change over a period of time; in the case presented, from the medical personnel to the psychological personnel and then to the patient himself.

Instead of regarding the beginning phase of casework as chiefly a study or exploratory phase, it is advocted that its purpose should be "to engage the applicant in working to use the help the agency can offer him… to help an 'applicant' to undertake the role of 'client."' Suggestions are made as to how this may be done. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- The psychosocial aspects of hemophilia are not as well understood as the medical problems it presents. Parents of hemophilic infants are confronted with the problem of giving their child physical protection without making him overdependent. The adolescent hemophilic may call into question his own adequacy in relation to most of the important adjustment indices in the adult world. Female relatives experience conflict arising from the fact that while they are not affected by the illness they may be carriers of the defective gene. "Self-help" groups are discussed as a valuable means of rendering therapeutic help to hemophiliacs and their families. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Areport of the work of the Intensive Treatment Unit at San Quentin which is testing the general hypothesis that prison inmates who receive intensive casework services will make a better parole adjustment than will those who do not receive such treatment. The report is of impressions and observations rather than statistical findings. Cases are cited which show that the problems of the men include emotional dependency, feelings of inadequacy, basic lack of trust, psychosexual conflicts, authority problems, schizoid patterns, and antisocial identifications. The examples cited suggest that the criminals' actions which may look "brave" and "bold" are a cloak to hide a sense of inadequacy. Basic casework principles of treatment appear applicable to this group of clients. "There is evidence that a helping relationship can be established with prisoners but it is too early to report on the effectiveness of casework treatment in modifying these severe psychological disorders."

KP- THERAPY FOR
KP- CHARACTERISTICS OF
KP- CRIME & DELINQUENCY
AB- A particular kind of casework treatment is required for delinquents because of their unique character structure. 2 factors are seen as characterizing the delinquent: persistence of instinctual drives and lack of sufficient internalized control of these drives. The author answers his own question of "why does a child become a delinquent instead of a neurotic?" by suggesting that the delinquent "externalizes his disturbance instead of internalizing his problem and developing symptoms." The treatment approach advocated is based on the assumption that the basic emotional defect of the delinquent derives from the parent-child relationship and involves "environmental change in terms of the delinquent's relationship to his therapist."

In both areas the purpose is to help the parent, particularly the mother, to help the child. With the preschool child, casework is primarily with the mother; with the latency child, it typically involves both the mother and the child. Differences in the 2 areas with respect to the casework process and its problems and limitations are discussed and illustrated. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- The authors contend that when a child experiences rejection a vicious cycle is generated in the parent-child relationship. "The child becomes anxious and insecure about whether or not his parents really love him. He then tests them, retaliates, rebels, or withdraws. The parents in turn, feel unappreciated and rejected, and their negative, hostile, and rejecting feelings are further stirred up, aggravated and intensified." Clinical experience is cited and the implications for casework with parents is discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

To illustrate his contention, the author cites the unusual piece of behavior known as "windigo psychosis," found among the Algonkian-speaking Indians of northeastern Canada. To fully understand this phenomenon one must consider it both psychiatrically and culturally. Each approach to understanding complements the other; each is essential.

AB- This is a report made after the 1st 2 years of a 4-year project in which the Community Service Society of New York is cooperating with the New York City Board of Education. The purpose of the project was to study the effects of an enriched school curriculum on children who live in an isolated deprived community. Hopefully it would help to alleviate a situation in which there is marked and steady deterioration in the performance and behavior of the school children when they reach the 5th grade. A program characterized as "preventive casework" utilizing the "positive approach" was instituted. The development and execution of the program is described and illustrated. Preliminary impressions suggest that it is resulting in improved school performance and more positive interpersonal relations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- The findings of a survey, conducted in a city near New York City, concerning the public's attitudes towards social work. Individuals in higher socioeconomic levels were most apt to recommend that professional help be sought with personal problems. The social worker was the professional least often suggested. Only 1 of the clients of social work agencies stated he learned of the agency through general and fund raising publicity. The bulk of an agency's clients learned of the agency through referrals, usually from a related professional. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- An elaboration and illustration, within the theoretical framework of sociology, of the thesis that family patterns are modified by the social setting in which they are found. Because the family as a creature of its environment is often subjected to great stress, it is concluded that the family agency must supply the leadership and skill necessary not only for the amelioration of problems but also for the imaginative rebuilding of a family equipped for a changing society.

This survey found the probable reasons to be in the following differences between the 2 classes: poorer women have less time (more children and less help), middle-class women have been exposed more to community activities in their upbringing, the morale of poorer women was lower, and poorer women were more concerned with bread and butter economics than emotional and social welfare.

The child's prelogical thinking presents an additional obstacle. To involve the child, the therapist should become active, but this very activity will make it difficult for the therapist to revert to the passivity recommended by classical Freudians.

AB- 10 male Ss between ages 20-23 years were ordered randomly. A statement given to the 1st S by E was relayed verbally, in isolation, from one to the other. This was repeated with a new random ordering for 4 statements; 2 with assumed high and 2 with assumed low emotional significance. Ss 1, 5, and 10 were compared for the number of original ideas retained (range from 4-6 per statement) and the number of new ideas added. The following points are thought to be clearly indicated by the results: "(a) The amount of distortion in the reproductions is directly related to the length of the original statement; (b) The statements lose their original shape in the reproduction of the fifth subject and there is not much loss of content from the fifth to the tenth subject; and (c) The difference in the reproductions of the first and the tenth subjects is significant although there is no systematically visible trend between those of the first and the fifth subjects."

AB- Samples of 100 office, and 100 manual workers were selected to each contain 50 Ss who were satisfied and 50 who were dissatisfied with their jobs. Ss were asked to indicate on a 24-item check list the reasons for their satisfaction, or dissatisfaction. The satisfied office workers most frequently checked: interesting work, social status, good supervisor; the satisfied manual workers: boss, interesting work, good fellow workers. The general pattern of factors considered significant for satisfaction were much alike for both groups (Rho = 0.74). The 2 groups differed significantly on factors causing dissatisfaction. Dissatisfied office workers most frequently mentioned: inadequate salary, not enough leave, no competition, hurts the ego, no visible result; dissatisfied manual workers: lack of security, no advancement, job not according to health. Rho = 0.30. Other findings were: length of tenure shifted the pattern of choice for satisfied workers in both groups whereas breakdowns according to age, family size, and number of dependents did not. The office group were more dissatisfied with their work. While salary and security were not listed as important by workers who are satisfied they were by the dissatisfied worker.

These efforts are described in terms of: structure of the agency, the workers' responsibilities, and the role of the administrator. The article concludes with some anecdotal reports of caseworkers' reactions to their experience with this kind of supervision. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Assertive casework is recommended for acting-out patients who are hard to reach. Unlike the neurotic, the acting-out patient cannot be helped by passive therapy. In assertive therapy the caseworker delineates realistic limits for the client and helps him discontinue the asocial actingout behavior which has been handicapping his social adjustment.

AB- Interviews of mothers who had been referred to other agencies after initial consultations at the clinic revealed that slightly more than half of the mothers accepted the referrals. A greater percentage of those who accepted the referrals, than the referral-rejecting mothers, reported improvement. The caseworker surmised that many of the referral-rejecting mothers reported improvement as means of denying their error in not following the recommendation. A higher percentage of those who accepted the referrals expressed positive feelings towards the clinic than those who did not follow the recommendation.

Cases illustrate the use of homemakers as substitutes for ill or deceased mothers; in the home where a mother, though mentally ill, is still living in the home; in the home where mothers, though reasonably normal, are overwhelmed by burdens; in assisting elderly persons. The decision to use a homemaker should be based on a sociopsychological diagnosis and may be constructively implemented by psychiatric consultation. Emphasis is upon maintenance of mental health and prevention of mental illness. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- A "directive" approach to casework treatment of the ambulatory schizophrenic is described. After describing characteristic schizophrenic symptoms, the author discusses the goal of casework with such a patient: re-orienting him to his present social reality rather than resolving internal psychological conflicts. The casework process is described in terms of these topics: patient-worker relationship, exploring the patient's problems, encouraging verbalization, holding the patient to reality, dealing with anger and paranoid ideas.

AB- Over the last 25 years, social casework has moved more and more in the direction of psychotherapy. Because of this change in emphasis, the caseworker must face new kinds of problems arising out of his relationship to his client. This in turn means that the supervisor must become more aware of her functions: providing certain emotional supports for the worker, perceiving the worker's difficulties, understanding the worker's self-image.

AB- Described in this paper are some of the possible reasons for discrepancies between the way the client evaluates the effectiveness of his counseling and how an agency review of the case record evaluates it: (a) Semantic differences between the way the client and agency define a problem. As problems were made more specific, client and agency agreed more on the nature of the problem. (b) Agency records can differ enough from one counselor to another so that extent of agreement between reviewer and client may be significantly reduced. (c) Client movement scores may be more sensitive to differences in the absolute level of adjustment than reviewer movement scores are. (d) The use of the movement scores to measure change does not appear to be an accurate way of predicting individual client change in the setting described in this study.

Just as the demanding child may threaten to hurt himself if his parents do not give in to him, so the adult patient may react to the doctor or social worker and similarly test him. The author believes that this reaction is a factor in provoking irregular discharges from sanitoriums, and describes how the social worker in handling the patient's "ultimatum" can help reduce this source of discharge.

AB- The caseworker in a court clinic is often handicapped by the distance between his middle class background and the common poorer environment of the court child. The fact that attendance at the clinic is compulsory is another source of distance in such cases. To overcome such hurdles active relationships with the child should be fostered by the therapist.

Kris concludes that social isolation is the social factor which most patients have to overcome to achieve adequate posthospital adjustment. Hitchman feels that most patient made average posthospital adjustment, although he recognizes that the drugs repress, but do not cure, symptoms. Jockel exhorts caseworkers to work to rehabilitate such patients. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

"The major aims of the study were to find out: How men whose wives were pregnant for the first time were reacting to their new status as prospective fathers; what problems they saw as most pressing in relation to the new situation; the extent of their participation in the care of the baby; the caseworker's use of the interviews with the husbands and the influence of these contacts on the treatment plans." Findings indicate an apparently strong capacity in men for responding to the birth of their children. Continued study is indicated. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Anxiety hysteria is found in the imbalance that results when the organism is unable to properly sublimate expression, usually in the latency period, of remnants of oedipal problems. Anxiety results also from the inability of the individual to balance properly the satisfaction of alternate and conflicting needs. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- The major goal of residential treatment is seen as a readaptation in the social relationships which are an outward manifestation of the conflict, rather than the removal, resolution, or repression of the inner conflicts. The social worker in a children's residential treatment program has an important role in: (1) influencing the natural community; (2) in the foster home program with specific responsibility for homefinding and study; (3) and as part of the therapeutic milieu. Social work's major contribution should lie in the prevention area—in a "reaching out" casework which gets into family situations and provides help before breakdown is reached.

Further consideration needs to be given the possibility of engaging both partners in a treatment plan. When the less troubled partner cannot be involved, however, the realization of the importance of the partner will alert us to all possible clues. Basic professional skills must be used in uncovering and appraising the forces impinging on and interacting with the client's needs and drives.

The author advocates working "with a smaller number of children and their parents than to work with many children and not their parents during a school year."

AB- 2 groups of diagnostic signs are posited as additional to those delineated by Kanner, Mahler and Bender in infantile psychosis. These signs include a failure to play or to have a distinct form of play and characteristic learning responses and "retreat from learned skills." 5 symptom areas are reviewed in the make-up of the ego-retarded child: orientation to people, orientation to reality, play, use of the body and speech. In addition 3 collateral signs are discussed: vegetative disturbances, domestication and rate of physical development. A "quantitative topological investigation based upon a systematic method of inquiry and recording" is offered as a substitute for functional history-taking. This method is believed to be useful in differential diagnosis and to secure significant insights. 2 detailed examples are cited. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Two sources of delinquent behavior are identified: intrapsychic disorder and "a social structure which inadequately provides support for value-oriented behavior." Social work diagnosis and treatment of delinquents have stressed the former source although it accounts for only a part of public correctional case loads. Analysis is made of the social structure of a high school showing that the values held in highest esteem by faculty are achievable only by a few students. Organized defiance of the adult value system may result in the formation of delinquent sub-cultural groups. "Creative invention" of opportunities is needed to reintegrate the delinquent into society.

The group therapy program of the Council Child Development Center in New York City is presented. Problems encountered in the treatment process included the limited production of fantasy, repressed or preconscious material and a lack of "sharp transference phenomena." Treatment was directed to characterological problems rather than the resolution of symptoms. Aims were "modification of defenses to change attitudes and to free ego functions for more constructive experience." A case report is elaborated in detail. In general the group process proved effective in creating movement where little was anticipated. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Aplea is made for identification and specification of ego-strengths in the client to achieve a more adequate diagnosis and treatment of his problems. Three "primary factors" in treatability are posited: the client's volition, his capacity and his opportunities. Criteria for identifying the first two factors are elaborated. They include the individual's "willingness" to use help, this capacity to relate to others, bearing the frustration of postponing gratification and working through his problem, accepting his own "feelings" and the use of "social intelligence." Treatability also depends on the client's willingness and adaptability in meeting new problems. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Resistance to help is seen as "inherent in the nature of human conflict" when no new or tested solutions to old problems are available. The role of the medical social worker in overcoming resistances is explored. Casework seeks "to help the perturbed patient use his energy in his own behalf, toward stabilized health and functioning up to his optimum capacity." Resistance may be based on feeling that treatment is too severe for the return benefit or that it threatens to restore the individual to function in a life with which he cannot cope. A threatened patient is more likely to resist, thus requiring casework intervention. Resistance, however, since it indicates a desire to survive is an aid to therapy if redirected to "promote the patient's efforts at self-preservation." A three-step casework program to help achieve this goal is outlined. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

The agency found it necessary to break up the family organization in order to free the girl from the influence of her grandmother and to give the children in the family a chance to develop without the handicapping influence of both the young mother and the old lady.

KP- SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS
AB- With a decreasing work week, an examination of leisure relative to work, class and family problems is needed. Work has come to be a central value in industrial civilization and society is unprepared for "the new leisure." Class differences are emerging in the meaning and use of leisure time. Work class attitudes reflect the wide acceptance of leisure and "work-saving" gadgets. Middle-class attitudes are more concerned with participation in community activities and some are "playing too hard at… trying to have productive and creative leisure." Family life is being fragmented by excessive participation. A community workshop organized to meet individual leisure needs is proposed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- As an individual grows up "idealized" and "actual" self-attitudes are formed. The system of concepts called "ideal" are formed in the interest of security; i.e., they help the individual maintain positive self-evaluation without forcing him to translate these into immediate action. Behavioral duplicity arises. Psychotherapy can help increase one's capacity to see oneself as one is. Educational institutions can help foster communal mental health through self acceptance by: (1) establishing a non-threatening acceptant climate; (2) giving the student the opportunity for expression of pent up emotions; and (3) becoming more concerned with promoting a spirit of acceptance and toleration in the student.

During these interviews the caseworker must be chiefly concerned with establishing a contact that may develop into a therapeutic relationship. This exploration, therefore, must be sensitive to the client's defenses and typical ways of reacting. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Therapeutic techniques which are effective with neurotic parents of delinquents do not appear to be appropriate for those parents who have "character disorders." Therapy with parents of this type is always a long term undertaking. The parent must go through 4 definite stages during treatment: (1) establishment of a strong relationship; (2) identification with the caseworker; (3) emotional separation from the caseworker; and (4) understanding his own behavior and origins. Various types of character disorders are described: oral, oral-erotic, oral-sadistic, anal, anal-erotic, and anal-sadistic. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Telephone inquiries were made of families that had come to the Institute for Juvenile Research (a Chicago child guidance clinic) and had not returned for therapy when the clinic offered them the time. Most said they had improved in the interim between initial consultation and the time the clinic called them for therapy. The length of the waiting period was not a factor in the failure of these people to accept therapy. Many thought they had been referred to another source.

The empirically grouped syndromes of paranoid, neuresthenic tendencies, and sleep disorders were very important in the sex delinquent group.

AB- Casteeism and untouchability are twin problems that seriously affect Indian society. Varna is an old concept dividing men into 4 classes by qualities or merits, not by birth. In modern times the varnas have been transformed into innumerable castes which are hereditary and rigid in boundary, e.g., prohibiting inter-dining and inter-marrying. Untouchability is restricted to certain indigenous Indians who do not belong to any of the 4 recognized castes. Surveys show public opinion to be against the practice of caste discrimination. Education is seen to play a dominant role in effecting the solution to this problem: social organization along old concept varna lines which recognizes capabilities of individuals.

AB- The author discusses the nature and process of casework diagnosis in its "truly creative and vital aspects." Diagnosis requires both knowledge and a disciplined method of thinking and begins with the making of observations—the question of "what" not "why." The focus must be on the person rather than the problem with attention to the accretion of evidence. The second step in the process of diagnosis requires a theoretical structure. "The danger is that theory may supplant rather than guide observations and that facts may be compelled to fit theory rather than theory be built to explain facts."

Returns indicated that the use of interview observation is very limited… . The great majority of respondents rejected this resource on the basis of considerations deriving from casework theory, educational theory, ethical obligations to the client, and anticipated practical and administrative difficulties." Contrary points of view, presented by respondents sympathetic to the idea of interview observation, are outlined. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

Basic data from cases of college students treated in a non-university clinic are considered in assessing the work of colleges in the area. As a rule, colleges tend to minimize the needs of their students for help. There are many cases where the student prefers to go to a college that is not connected with the school because school employed therapists are apt to be looked upon as parent substitutes.

AB- This article is based upon the author's supervisory casework experience at a clinical summer camp for boys aged 8 to 14 who were referred for diagnostic study. Almost all had serious conduct disorders. An aspect of institutional casework is dealt with differing in goals and methods from the more usual residential therapy. "It is not directed primarily toward bringing about fundamental character changes; it is directed toward helping the child with his everyday problems of adjustment." The caseworker "utilizes the interview to help a client find a solution to an immediate and pressing conflict." The caseworker must call upon his highest faculties of diagnosis to deal with the immediate situation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

Experience with this type of casework has pointed up (1) the need for further knowledge and research, (2) our lack of workable problem classification in casework, (3) the complementary integration of the group work and casework method, (4) that family-centered casework constitutes further development of the psychiatric function of treating mental illness through treatment of the family, and (5) that family-centered casework is an indication of the maturation of social work.

Adjustments are made because "(1) mobile families feel a strong sense of group unity; (2) families able to move and still to continue to be healthy and well adjusted have learned to 'settle in' in each place they live; and (3) escape or independence is an adequate device in meeting the needs of some families."

This can best be done within the framework of progressive philosophy. Planning and programming suggestions are made covering: typical daily routine, plant and equipment, health program, social service and parents' participation.

AB- Through case presentation, the author discusses special aspects of "family-oriented" treatment of marital problems in a family agency. It is concluded that (1) casework treatment of marital problems must be based on sound diagnosis which includes a psycho-social understanding of two partners as individuals and of the interactive relationship between them which functions as a "third force"; (2) treatment, whenever possible, should be made available to both partners in the reciprocal relationship of marriage; (3) in casework with marital problems the arena for treatment of each individual is the adaptive functioning of the ego.

He attempts to demonstrate the validity of the point of view which holds that the treatment of the older person and his place in the family affects significantly the welfare and social orientation of subsequent generations. Some of the outstanding factors that relate to problems of aging are discussed in terms of (1) sociological forces, (2) emotional forces to which the older person is exposed, (3) the effect on other members of the family.

The results are described. In general, the authors feel that communication between patient and relative as well as between social worker and relative was increased. The conferences seem to encourage the coordination of, and cooperation with, the various hospital services. A large majority of relatives felt that such conferences should be continued and that they helped them gain a better understanding of mental illness.

The author feels recognition of these difficulties is necessary, since an awareness of common problems shared by the resident and social worker will help the latter assume maximum responsibility for dealing with his own feelings, for contributing to the rounded education of the residents and for giving good service to the patients. In describing these difficulties the author does not infer that positive factors do not predominate in the total relationship between social worker and resident.

In illustration the author describes specific experimental programs in a variety of communities. The authors emphasizes that professional "experts" should not assume exclusive responsibility or planning for mental health programs. Ultimately the citizens of community must assume this responsibility, with the help of specialists. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- The history of children's play experiences is meaningful not only during the time it is engaged in; certain lasting and recurring elements can be discovered within the total of children's play experiences which mirror their personality. By a careful study of children's play performance these relatively stable elements can be discovered. Three play histories are described to illustrate this principle. The author concludes that the play history can be a useful tool for the caseworker, both in her diagnostic as well as preventive work. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

The thesis presented is that in order for such a leader to fulfill his role effectively, he needs to have a psychodynamic orientation in these areas: adult learning; the nature of emotional health and pathology; motivation of behavior; normal growth and development of children; the relationships between parents and the developmental stages through which their children go; group processes and interrelationships.

It was noted that these groups "do not respond automatically to improved social conditions." Over 50% of the juvenile delinquents were born in Israel. The failure to become integrated into the changing society creates serious problems. The need for considering the problems of the parents as well as the children is emphasized. Community disorganization, especially in the Oriental communities, has served to accentuate difficulties in the integrative process. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

Prominent factors appeared to be: aggravated home conditions (wife's adultery, loose parental control, etc.), companionship (the influence of others), jealousy and revenge, intoxication, adolescent disturbances, and social heritage (member of a so-called criminal tribe). Methods of preventing adolescent crime are discussed; these include improvement of home conditions, spread of education, provision of wholesome facilities for recreation, more effective police supervision, improvement of penal system, and making justice cheap, speedy and fair.

Another (negative) group assumed the counselor had no sympathy or understanding, and they answered the same questions. It was concluded that an adolescent expects a helpful counselor to focus his attention on the relation—he would be: (1) eager to continue the relation, (2) willing to involve himself in the counselee's problems, (3) sensitive to therapy developments, (4) able to understand the adolescent's striving for independence, and (5) able to set reasonable limits in the therapeutic setting.

AB- Through use of police records 500 crimes in Calcutta were analyzed to determine if any particular crime was overemphasized, and if so, what was the make-up of the offending group. Of the 500, 320 were sex crimes; the offenders were preponderantly adolescents coming from middle class homes, unemployed, and possessing, or in the process of obtaining, an adequate standard of education. Explanation is offered by tracing society's role for, and group outlets of, youths from the middle 1930's on. The war and the great famine are thought to have played a large part in the decline of the morale and morals of the youth. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Historically, large groups of people of various tribes turned to acts not approved by custom or law in order to gain a livelihood when all else failed. At the time of independence, 1952, there were about 3,500,000 persons of this sort, preponderantly nomads but also including hunters, farmers, and fisherfolk. In dealing with the problem prior to 1952 compulsory registration of whole groups, with guilt by association implications, and poorly chosen and poorly administered settlements, of which some were virtual prisons, did little to rehabilitate these people, and actually aggravated the situation. With independence ex-criminal groups became free citizens of a free country. Legal justice, however, did not guarantee social justice. A program of social and economic rehabilitation and integration with the rest of society is suggested. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Adolescents are most apt to seek help with problems related to school and vocational planning. They are least inclined to seek help for more personal problems regarding adjustments with the other sex and family relations. The person they would go to for help differed with the kind of problem considered. Adolescents do not like to be considered different in a maladjusted way. This often is the reason why they do not seek help. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

All tended to be "immature" and "tied to their own parents." Casework with this group helped them become more "manly" and was believed to represent "a reasonably valuable addition to the therapy their wives received from the psychiatrists." Suggestions are made for further study of husbands of women with postpartum psychosis and tentative hypotheses proposed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

Data collected support the following conclusions: (1) counselors and similar professional workers vary in their attitude toward the use of such technical research aids as the Marriage Council schedules; (2) the more workers use these schedules the more favorable become their attitudes toward their use; (3) initial attitude toward use seemed to grow directly out of counselor's professional orientation; (4) when counselors can see the "harmlessness" of the schedules to the client, they tend to become more accepting of their use; (5) "atmosphere" in a given agency with regard to the integration of evaluative procedures also is related to counselors' change of attitude toward the schedules.

Factors significantly related to number of interviews: (1) the problem with which the client sought help; (2) the client's response to the worker's proposals or suggestions for solution of the core or basic problem; (3) the client's conception of the worker's role at the beginning of the interview; (4) the client's acceptance of the worker in a counseling role by the end of the interview. Factors related with positive movement and not significantly to the number of interviews: source of referral, problem area, insight, resistance and degree to which the client is overwhelmed.

This requires not only flexibility in program but in the youth worker as well who must be willing to adjust schedules and activities to meet the needs of youth rather than adhere to a rigid routinized plan.

Factor analysis of these, plus another near significant item, suggests a general factor running through all of the attitudinal items that may be identified with some sort of general confidence in the company and its management. The existence of a "fairly clear-cut pro- or anti-company attitude" is postulated. The former is largely present among non-union workers and the latter amongst union workers.

AB- A multiple choice questionnaire was distributed to 715 literate workers and 83 supervisors of a "unit in Bombay." The returns were 485 and 43 respectively. The results suggest that "good and efficient workers and good employee morale cannot be built up by just swelling the pay envelopes of the workers." It can be concluded that workers want "suitable work", and supervisors want "preservation of self-respect," and that "the relationship between employees and the employers is of more importance to achieve maximum productivity and happiness than any other factor."

The author discusses ways in which procedures such as seeing patient's relatives, writing hospital reports, using the psychiatric consultant, supervising use of money allowance, etc. can be used as helpful authority. The establishment of a relationship with the patient is crucial and much depends upon how the trial visit status is interpreted to him. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Intrusive casework is defined as "action on the part of the social worker to enable patients to overcome resistance to the help they need so desperately." It involves an assumption by the social worker of more than the usual initiative and responsibility in casework planning. The technique is distinguished from the "aggressive" approach in preventive casework. The author discusses the use of intrusive casework with the chronic, regressed patient who is not only incapable of making decisions but also unwilling to enter into planning that will project him back into society. Case summaries are used for illustration. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- While the total prison population has dropped about 16% in the past 15 years, the proportion of Jewish prisoners to prisoners in general has so altered that there are now less than two-fifths as many as compared to the earlier figure. Searching for the cause of this drop, Rabbi Melamed points out that contrary to the popular canard, it is not the foreign born who make up the preponderant number of Jewish prisoners in Joliet prison. Neither is poverty or economic stress the principal underlying factor in crimes committed by Jews. Nor has it been due to exposure to at least a minimal Jewish education. It is rather when the security elements of the home, love, discipline, mutual respect and the like undergo deterioration that the children develop the aggressions which lead to criminal acts in the Jew.

A case is reported to illustrate this method. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- 20 cases from a child guidance clinic were examined. In most cases the child-patient was rejected, and when there were other siblings, he had been singled out for rejection. The rejection preceded identification by the parent of the child-patient with a psychotic relative. The identification was a rationalization to cloak the mother's hostility and a method the mother used to relieve herself of responsibility for her son's behavior. The child-patient was singled out for rejection because he touched off problems troubling the mother. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

Contrary to expectations, the number of referrals from (1) the poor, (2) slum areas, and (3) areas nearest the clinic were not disproportionately high. Those from privileged areas were more prone to receive treatment while the others were more likely not to continue in treatment after initial interviews. The wealthier were more apt to have been referred by private professionals rather than by social agencies. The symptoms of the wealthier were of a withdrawal nature to greater extent than was the case among those of moderate or poor means. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Few significant differences were found between clinic treated children who were adopted and others who were not. The adoptive mothers were somewhat more overanxious and over-protective. The natural mothers were more overtly hostile, probably because they felt secure enough to express their true feelings. The adopted children were more apt to display withdrawal symptoms, while the others were likely to display acting out symptoms. In other comparisons, no appreciable differences between the groups was noted. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

This "uniqueness" should not be unqualified, however, for the characteristics of social work grow out of its relationships to other sciences. In order to avoid confusion, it is necessary for social workers to distinguish between problems which arise out of the nature of the profession itself, and those which arise out of the scientific body of knowledge upon which that profession rests.

AB- A psychoanalytic interpretation of the "Yoke of Judaism" and its effect upon American Jewry. In the author's opinion "the problem of both the Jew and non-Jew lies in their unsuccessful attempt to handle the memory and guilt of an ancient, yet current, experience normal to all men and inherent in the history of all peoples." This ancient crime he believes consisted of "the rebellion by the sons of the primordial horde against their father, his murder, and subsequent apotheosis." The solution would appear to depend upon the success with which self-acceptance and pride in the awareness of a common goal with his fellowmen can be established in the American Jew.

AB- A group of mothers of well adjusted children was compared with mothers of clinic children. The difference was one of degree, rather than of kind. The mothers of the adjusted children were not all-loving and all-patient; nor were they free of problems and tensions. It was the intensity of the mother's conflicts and anxieties, as well as the intensity of the children's problems that distinguished the two groups. The mother of the disturbed child was typically more unhappy and discontent with hereself both as a person and as a mother. The poor mother-child relation was a symptom of deeper conflict in the mother. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- The author describes the process (a study of 100 cases over a five year period) by which his agency tested its skills in early adoptive placements. Answers were sought to these questions: (1) how many babies might the agency have placed earlier and with equally favorable results; (2) what misplacements may have been made; (3) should more weight have been given to knowledge of the child's background; (4) how did the child's development and psychological testing alter the placement potential. Conclusions point to placement as early an age as is consistent with the facts to be important for the development of healthy personality.

Of this group six were considered for full time placement, while the remainder attended school within a foster care institution or the regular public schools. Varying degrees of success were attained by those successfully placed but at least half of them have done well enough to continue this pioneer effort to aid these young people lead a fuller, more independent life.

For the Jew the negative evaluation of self may lead to anti-Semitic action, to overaccentuation of Jewishness or to seeking for identification with the majority group through anti-racial or anti-religious attitudes toward other readily identificable minorities. Minorities must see that the individuals who compose them accept themselves with dignity, appreciate their own self-worth and be willing to fight to protect such rights.

Special complications arise as a result of being Jewish, such as dietary restrictions, some increased tendency to feel persecuted as a result of minority status, and other related factors. Only improved mental hygiene and provision of opportunity through acceptance of the aged and planning for their adequate satisfaction in life can alleviate their emotional distress. This calls for the creation of "social institutions dedicated to equality of opportunity for men of all ages." (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Vast shifts in population, appalling housing conditions, and increased insecurity have combined to increase juvenile delinquency in India in the last six years. A Bill was recently introduced in the Council of States providing for the care of "… destitute and neglected children and juvenile delinquents." The reader's attention is directed to what are felt to be omissions of this bill. E.g., the job of running a juvenile court is thought to be the job of a specialist and the main prerequisite for juvenile court magistrate is "eagerness to learn." Segregation of the children with respect to problem and/or handicap, and legal provision for more adequate measures against non-cooperative parents and guardians are also suggested as modifications.

It is felt that these corrections will best be carried out in collaboration with police, school, and hospital authorities, recreation and women's organizations, and the family itself. Following the exploration of the correctional system in India and concepts of delinquency, a method for implementing a preventive program utilizing Delinquency-prevention Centres is suggested, and general recommendations including proposed legislation are made.

An important feature of social case work service is the focussing on the person as a whole in an attempt to understand his problem; i.e., the client is studied in his home, neighborhood, school, playground, and work place, and his physical and moral development explored. Past history of the client is also stressed. A type of supportive therapy, based on the principle of acceptance, and some problems that arise in thus treating delinquents are discussed.

All these aspects of character formation and others are discussed as elements often overlooked in vocational counseling practice to the detriment of the counselee.

Careful evaluation of this approach in treatment is needed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

The patient needs to be seen as an individual with his own psychodynamic structure, and also as a person with many roles to play in his adult life. A patient's discussion of his children may lead to a fuller understanding of his psychodynamics, as well as a broader picture of the reality situation and the patient's relationship with his own parents. Becoming a more capable parent is a part of the aim of therapy—to help the patient develop a more adequate personal existence. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

Gomberg pays heed to the gap existing between causality and treatment theories. The lessening of this gap is occurring, however, as is seen in our increased recognition of the father as an important member of the family constellation and the need to bring him into the treatment sphere: similarly the importance of the social interactions of each member of the family upon the other is finding its place in the treatment as well as the diagnostic phase of casework.

AB- 30 former clients of the clinic who had been treated 20 years ago were contacted in an effort to determine current patterns of marital adjustment and adjustment to parenthood. Symptomatology in former clients' children, where it exists, tends to follow the symptoms parents previously exhibited and for which they were treated at the clinic. Case history material illustrates the positive effect of treatment on marital choice and adjustment. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Using the Glueck Social Prediction Table on 100 Jewish delinquent boys at the Hawthorne-Cedar Knolls School, the authors found it "to be a valid instrument for the early detection of potential delinquency." Of the five factors selected for study, a significant difference was found in "the internal distribution of the abnormal disciplinary relationship between fathers and sons." The authors conclude from their investigation that "the central theme of a disturbed relationship to parents appears to be a specific for delinquency." It further appears that all five of the factors which deal with the relationship between parents and children are dynamically intertwined with the presence of delinquency.

A group of 25 men and 25 women between the ages of 25 and 50 were studied. Language achievement, socio-cultural patterns, attitudes toward America and toward the Resettlement Service were examined and led the investigators to conclude that "the men had achieved a greater adjustment than the women."

The focus is on reaching the parents, rather than direct treatment of the child. The author discusses the need for a more "assertive casework" to meet social responsibility to hard-to-reach parents, the defenses parents cling to when facing breakdown, the necessity to recognize and help with physical and socio-economic needs, difficulties in helping when the parents have severe emotional limitations, and demands placed on the worker.

AB- While emotionally-stable children are generally considered as enjoying and profiting from a summer camp, Dover points out that "for the emotionally disturbed child, any change, such as going to camp, holds great threat for him." This paper describes the part which casework can play in overcoming this disturbance and in serving "as an aid to the other community resources devoted to the treatment of the emotionally disturbed."

AB- Social casework, like clinical psychology, has been a part of the controversy on who shall practice psychotherapy. Rabinowitz points out that there is no basis for the view "that environmentally-created mental illness is necessarily or should be solely the province of the medical profession." In light of this she reviews the important elements in the professional training for those who seek to carry on private practice and the safeguards that will serve the best interest of the public while at the same time properly define the minimal acceptable standards for these practices by professional case-workers.

This method is contrasted to the traditional intake function of "history-taking." Goal of the interview is to provide a reality-testing experience for the patient within which he can (1) clarify his problem; (2) assess what he has already attempted to do about it; (3) assess his motivation for utilizing help and identify some of his resistances; (4) decide whether he can get and accept the treatment he wants.

Both children and their parents can thus be helped when the social program calls for a casework plan that aims at the resolution of both sets of problems. The author uses case material to substantiate her employment of this dualistic approach in a girls' club providing living quarters for adolescents removed from their families or foster families because of inability to adapt in the home environs.

The causes of absentism are threefold: relating to conditions in industry, to those outside the factory, and to the personal and social life of the worker. Analysis of absentism is made with respect to age, length of service, civil (marital) status, birth place, distance traveled to work, type of illness, and illness in the family. Suggestions made in tackling the problem include making management policies clear-cut, incentive schemes, education (health, safety, personal hygiene), and welfare activities.

AB- A description of the work of the Family Service of Philadelphia with children. A psychologist is used part time for testing; a psychiatrist supervises and teaches, although he is not a child psychiatrist. The main employees of the agency, social caseworkers, have been treating an increasingly wide range of children's emotional problems on all levels—from insight therapy to educational and environmental manipulation.

AB- The author cites the difficulty arising in treatment of a parent when his welfare tends to be of interest to the staff only as it has bearing on the welfare of the child. Only if parents are helped with own problems will therapy succeed in primary goal of helping the child. Help for himself becomes the dominant motive of the parent when his therapy passes beyond its earliest phase. Discussed to support these views are: (1) the parent's part in the diagnostic process; (2) aspects of planning therapy for parents; (3) objections of parent-centered focus; (4) why child-centered therapy may appear successful; (5) collaboration as a hindrance to parent's therapist; (6) problem children of successfully treated parents.

(3) Twice as many fee as non-fee cases were highly improved. (4) Negro clients improved more than others.

It is suggested that it might be helpful for social work to look again at its ways of operating in order to reduce the frustrations, anxieties, and work inhibitions of its staff members.

The impulsive group displayed mainly acting out symptoms while the inhibited were mainly withdrawn. The two groups overlapped both in symptomatology and in developmental history. The inhibited tended to have parents who were overcontrolled, while the impulsive had parents who differed among themselves and were predominantly impulsive.

On the basis of present knowledge the author recommends the following improvements in penal institutions as essential: (1) expansion of probation and parole; (2) greater use of indeterminate sentence; (3) more adequate appropriations; (4) improved diagnostic and techniques of prisoners; (5) experiment in small specialized institutions; (6) enriching the activities programs of prisoners; (7) improved personnel; (8) acceptance of the philosophy that prisoners are people.

KP- ALCOHOLISM
KP- WIFE'S PERSONALITY
KP- BEHAVIOR PROBLEMS
AB- The author concludes "… that there is much clinical evidence pointing to the fact that in many instances the wife of an alcoholic unconsciously, because of her own needs, seems to encourage her husband's alcoholism. On the basis of her own ego ideal formed from her identification with a dominant mother, the wife unconsciously feels inadequate and… chooses as her foil a dependent, weak male… . When this symbiotic relationship is disturbed by an improvement on the part of the husband, the wife decompensates. In many cases we find a reproduction in the wife of the family situation of her childhood." (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

KP- VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE
KP- THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVE
AB- The theoretical framework of vocational service is considered. Vocational service is defined as "the process of helping an individual make an adjustment to an occupation." Lusting points out, however, that there is a great deal of difference between placement interviewing and vocational counseling. Therefore, different people are required to carry on the different requirements of clients seeking aid. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

The importance of the case workers' "knowledge of, an identification with, and a respect for the total view of children's hospitalization held by the administration of the hospital" is called to attention.

In the working situation cases have, in general, been selected which have "a favorable prognosis and have found that generally we can work within a time span of 50 to 75 sessions, usually twice a week for adults." Direct treatment of pathology is left in the hands of the psychiatrist. A case is described to show how psychiatric treatment and social work counseling are integrated.

In slightly over half of the cases, one or both partners was given help in achieving increased self-understanding of his part in the marriage problems. Slightly less than half the cases were those where the primary difficulties stemmed from social pressures and where the casework treatment was directed towards helping the client improve his reality situation.

The "social work culture" and the problems of adjustment it brings between worker and client are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Comparison between a group of children who later became schizophrenic with a control group who, although seen at the same mental hygiene center, did not subsequently develop schizophrenia revealed marked differences. The schizophrenic group displayed to greater extent the following: temper outbursts, shyness, disinterest, seclusiveness, excessive daydreaming, sleep disturbances, fluctuations between extremes of behavior, poor social relations, malnourishment, frequent illnesses, and asthenic body build. They were more likely to have lived in slum areas, and they were more apt to have parents who were: mentally ill, rejecting, domineering, overprotective, full of conflicts, and cruel. There were more broken homes among the schizophrenics and the circumstances causing the break in the home were more emotionally disturbing.

These results are related to what psychologists and psychiatrists know about schizophrenia on the basis of their own methods of investigation.

AB- This is the second and concluding part of a discussion of stuttering (see 28: 1266). The author emphasizes that treatment of the stutterer must be based upon sound psychological insights and may take the form of "psychoanalysis, analytically oriented psychotherapy, and psychiatric plus casework therapy conducted by a therapeutic team." Such types of treatment as hypnosis, vocal and rhythmic exercises and various devices of distraction are not "therapies of choice" and only serve to strengthen the isolation of the symptom and the patient's resistance to treatment. The author enlarges upon the change in self-image: from organ to total organism; schizoid and masochistic defenses, special problems, and the treatment adaptation by the therapeutic team.

Mechanical aspects of the task of integrating group work and casework within the clinic setting are described: structure of groups, scheduling of appointments, materials and equipment, recording methods. The authors see the mechanical problems as the primary ones since it became evident that the two methods embody the same common philosophy, goals, and basic understanding of the needs of children.

The author sees an urgent need to define more clearly the function of the psychiatric social worker and recognize appropriate schools of training.

AB- The author maintains that the primary purpose of supervision—whether it be in an analytic training situation or between social work student and supervisor or social worker and supervisor—is essentially a didactic one, not a therapeutic one. She discusses this point in the light of an historical point of view, relating developments in supervision to the development of dynamic concepts in psychiatry, progressive education, and in the training and bringing up of children. She further discusses the emotional reactions of students in training, the nature of professional training in supervision, and the differences between the didactic and the therapeutic situation.

Furthermore, the interrelationship of such factors as parental attitudes, death or absence of one parent, broken homes, confusion regarding proper sex identification, relations with putative father, and of precipitating factors are stressed. Treatment to prevent recurrence of the initial pregnancy must be directed toward much more frequent and more intensive case work procedures along lines which are suggested.

This program, as utilized in the JVS in Chicago, is described. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Incidents of social workers' behavior were classified into the six qualities which social workers had agreed to be necessary for success in the field. When these incidents were presented to workers for rating, there was good agreement as to whether the behavior was good social work practice, but very marked disagreement as to what quality was indicated by the behavior. This, it was observed, may be due to the fact that personality is a whole and should not be compartmentalized into isolated bits. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- The author presents some of the data from a recent study having as its goal the securing of information in the following areas of professional interest: "(1) in what types of psychiatric hospitals and psychiatric clinics is social casework being practiced? (2) who are the people engaged in this practice? and (3) what is it that the social caseworkers are doing in these places?" Most of the discussion in this paper deals with the "who are they" portion of the study and presents facts in these areas. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- This is a discussion of Tessie D. Berkman's paper (see 27: 5125). The discussant points out that only one-fifth of the fully trained psychiatric workers are spread out in the many state hospitals; that one-third had their field work training in mental hospitals; that the rich teaching material in mental hospitals is not being utilized in social work education. Suggestions are given as to curriculum content for schools to help correct this lack. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

The placement problem for any individual child is a dynamic process that may go on long after the child has been provided a foster home. To effectively meet the many problems involved in placement and follow-up, it is necessary to call upon an intensive and extensive knowledge of the psychological factors. While not every psychiatrist may be prepared to meet the demands of this kind of situation, one who is equipped to work with a social agency is of great importance.

The results point to a trend indicating that the percentage of such cases is substantial with the "mild" case tending to be retained in the institution and the "serious" ones being discharged to friends, relatives and at times to State mental institutions. The author emphasizes the need for careful study and planning to establish the most effective communal program for meeting the mentally ill aged.

The time used by the social worker "to control my relationship to them" and "the self-responsibility exercised by the client to control the help they wanted" appears to support, in a limited fashion, the author's belief in the importance of these concepts in dealing with the older people.

Some of the results of this analysis are at variance with those already published. The areas of agreement and disagreement are summarized.

AB- Records of 40 psychoneurotic veterans were studied to select the factors related to their continued disabilities. Those who had been in the service longest prior to their disabilities had the best adjusted pre-service case histories. While this group remained generally better adjusted than the others in the post-service period, it failed to reach its old adjustment level by a wider margin than was the case for the others. It is concluded that those who underwent the most stress before succumbing to the war's stresses were left with the most psychological scars.

Recommendations for changes were submitted by the government to the administration and reports were received as to the hospital's reaction to the suggestions. The meetings enabled patients to express overtly their hostilities towards the hospital and to criticise both themselves and each other. The moods of the meetings varied, depending on the patient chairman who led the discussions. Most participants said the meetings were desirable but denied that they had been helped personally.

KP- FATHER REFERRED CASES
AB- Case histories of 2 groups of children, one brought to the clinic for guidance by fathers and the other by mothers, were studied. Fathers were more apt to bring adolescents and boys rather than younger children and girls. Fathers were more likely to be concerned with delinquent behavior of the children. Mothers were less cooperative when the cases were brought by the fathers. In both groups the father-child relationships were generally more healthy than the relationship of mother to child. The father-child relationship was generally warmer in those cases referred initially by the fathers. Reversal of parental roles was more common in the father-referred cases.

KP- TREATMENT METHODS
AB- Both verbal and nonverbal reassurance can be used to advantage in therapy. More skill is required for verbal reassurance and more damage is likely to result from its inept use; therefore it should be more sparingly used than non-verbal types. Silence, when the patient utters condemnatory remarks, and attitudes of acceptance and understanding are among the most effective forms of inexpressed reassurance. Statements relieving patients of their feelings of peculiarity, showing respect for and confidence in the patient, giving the patient responsibility for his own improvement, setting therapeutic limits and controls, and reminding the patient of his positive feelings—all serve as verbal reassurances when properly administered.

AB- The problems of the social worker and the agency in dealing with clients who terminate their relationship after a single interview are presented. Many of the cases arise out of the inability of the client and worker to find a suitable approach to the client's problem in the initial contact. This is due in part to difficulties attendant upon the worker in rapidly relating to the inner feelings of the client. A number of sample situations are discussed. The writer concludes that as inter-personal relationship can be improved through clinical diagnosis and empathy, fewer cases will terminate after a single interview and, when they do, greater help will have been given the client than has been true in the past.

He must play a leader's role in every aspect of the institution's program. Thus the staff must become integral elements in aiding the director to fulfill his role in a coordinated and integrated manner. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

Notable gains were noted after therapy and after the follow-up period in that the improved patients tended to (1) have better relations with girls of similar age (but not with boys), (2) have improved vocational adjustments, and (3) be less hostile towards their parents.

AB- The difficulties involved in the collaboration of the psychiatrist with social workers as well as with general medical practitioners and psychologists is explained as due to the tendency of psychiatrists "to embrace possessively whatever was helpful in a psychological sense, and label it as a form of psychotherapy." This tends to place all of the associated professional groups in a position of inferiority. The need, therefore, for a closer and more truly collaborative relationship is emphasized. The regular and consistent use of the psychiatrist instead of the "emergency case" approach, the avoidance of using the psychiatrist for purely diagnostic purposes, and the development of a more adequate intercommunication between psychiatrist and social worker are potential sources of improvement in the professional situations.

Some of the difficulties in securing such effective cooperation are indicated. Most often they are centered around either interprofessional anxieties and insecurities or failure to establish a mutually cooperative program. The establishment of the initial phases of such a plan are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- There is apparently considerable variance in the manner in which various social agencies utilize the service of the psychiatrist. In the agency represented by the author the psychiatrist is used primarily as a consultant on individual cases and as a seminar leader on psychiatric problems. The necessity for classification of the role of worker, supervisor, and psychiatrist is stressed so that conflict areas may be minimized. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

In bringing the psychiatrist into this phase of the program, better understanding of the agency role may be attained. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

Purpose of the psychiatric study and evaluation was to determine the applicant's need for institutional care and the institution's ability to provide such care. The authors conclude such psychiatric evaluation of applicants for admission about whom there is question is useful in the selection of people who will adapt well in the institutional setting.

In contrast to many of the primitive cultures, our society makes heavy demands upon the adolescent and at the same time fails to provide him with a preconceived and carefully outlined pattern to help him meet these demands. The social pressures upon the adolescent which result are discussed in terms of our society's emphasis upon self-development, the conflicting standards presented to children, limitations of school and free time activities, and variations in rate of maturation in different individuals.

The use of the work "preventive" implies an attempt "to arrest a damaging parent-child relationship before it becomes a full-blown emergency." The author believes the family casework agency has a community responsibility to depart from its sometimes too passive role and to move out more firmly to certain clients. Case illustrations are given. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

Skills discussed, with case illustrations, are those relating to helping the client (1) with a part of his problem, or (2) to bring out the real problem, or (3) to discuss the problems he is avoiding. Skills in use of resources, telephone, and recording are also discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

Case records must be appraised in terms of adequacy, validity, and representativeness for specific research objectives. A combination of skill in research and the professional practice of social work is needed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

Although a psychotherapeutic approach was used with the emotional problems, the aim was to treat the problems only to the point at which they were no longer a barrier to medical care and recovery. While the casework treatment had the particular focus of the medical setting, concurrent with the physical improvement was seen a change of direction in the emotional growth of the child.

AB- "The purpose of the study presented here is twofold: (1) investigation of the effect of an expanded scale on judgments of movement and (2) determination of whether social work students as well as experienced caseworkers can learn and use the Movement Scale." It is concluded that the general adoption of a 70-step scale of movement in place of the seven step scale is justified. The writers hesitated to conclude that social work students would be as competent as experienced caseworkers in using the scale since a few of the students in the study had had casework experience. More studies using student judges are indicated. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

The essential aim of the therapist was to lend friendly support to the patient, and to confine discussion to the plane of present reality without, however, rejecting the irrealities (past or present) raised by the patient. Caseworkers can help in the total treatment of psychotics by fostering friendly personal relationships which furnish the patient with necessary current support.

AB- Cultural factors play a vital role in the development of the personality which a social worker brings to his job. His life experiences reflect the worker's racial, economic, and religious background, as well as his social class status, his class allegiances, and habits of thought and behavior. These attitudes, goals, and needs interact with those of his client who is also materially influenced by the impact of his own culture. This interaction is not always recognized but may be active entirely at an unconscious level, disguised in rationalizations, theoretical assumptions and technical procedures. Unfamiliarity with the client's cultural group causes the worker to fall back on standards derived from his own culture. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- As a rule, bringing the family of a disturbed child to the clinic after a relationship has been established with the mother is unlikely to help the child. When the father is brought in at the request of the mother the outcome is apt to be completely negative. It is usually the mother with strongly hostile feelings towards her husband who requests that therapy be given him. Rivalrous family situations further contraindicate therapy for both parents simultaneously. They are likely to vie with each other for the therapist's attention. However this can be counter-acted by assigning different therapists for each parent. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

The social worker should expect transference of feelings the patient has towards contemporary rather than towards parental figures. The cases studied revealed that the foregoing recommendations were more likely to be followed when a psychiatrist was administering therapy at the same time that the social worker was rendering his services. However, those workers who followed these principles were no more successful in their therapies than those who followed a more flexible approach in which techniques were varied to meet changes in the situation noted by the caseworker.

AB- The maladjustment of twins often reflects their twin status in which they experience unusually intense competitive and rivalrous feelings. They are torn between feeling and acting as half of a whole and between their desire for independence from the dependency of this status. Complementary personality development is the rule; and among more rigid twin personalities division of labor attitudes prevail in which a twin expects the personality and behavior of the other to fill the vacuum he leaves. This development is traced to the ambivalent attitudes of the parents, especially the mother. In no event is the environment exactly identical for both twins.

While some difficulty in administering out-patient clinic therapy to institutionalized children arises from the fact that the therapist is associated with an outside agency, this handicap can be overcome; and institutions can profit a good deal by availing themselves of out-patient assistance for their children. For greatest therapeutic effectiveness it is recommended that the clinic and the institution operate on a personal and human, rather than perfunctory and impersonal, plane in their relationships both towards each other and towards the children.

The problem of referral of the mother, child, or both, to a community resource should be based upon a diagnostic decision including casework, psychiatric and psychological evaluation. The need for continuing a casework contact after a lapse of a few months appears to be important. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- After discussing various psychological and social factors which lead to sexual promiscuity, the author focuses on the psychological and social difficulties of the young unmarried mother who comes to a social agency for help. Agencies are frequently unduly influenced by psychiatry. They show this tendency when they ascribe "deep abnormalities" to all unmarried mothers. A consistent application of this point of view crowds out the "practical help" that social case work offers, for "social case work is something in its own right, and not just a poor substitute for, an adjunct to, psychiatry."

AB- The development of the diagnostic concept in casework is discussed briefly followed by a partial analysis of short contact cases in the F.S.A.A. study (1948) and in the author's own agency. Valid reasons are seen for short contact cases and their increase in the past 5 years. Emphasis is placed upon the need for more careful diagnosis at time of intake. A need is seen for a more precise definition of terms among family agencies who want to examine short contact cases. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Social casework as a skill has been adapted to many settings, subject to some modifications of technique and scope to fit a specific working environment. This report of the process of psychiatric casework in the out-patient department of a United States army general hospital illustrates its similarity to the casework process in many civilian psychiatric settings. "The basic skill of casework is the same in all settings. Casework is applicable to the military community to the same degree that it applies to any well-organized community."

AB- The researchers examined 6 questions in relation to initial interviews in a family case work agency: (1) problems of new clients; (2) source of new applications; (3) client attitudes exhibited at intake; (4) disposition of the case at the conclusion of the first interview; (5) number of client contacts before the case is closed; and (6) the interrelation of the above 5 factors. Limitations in the data perhaps contribute to making the study more important for further research than for practice. There was "confirmation of an hypothesis long held by caseworkers: What happens in the first interview is, more often than not, predictive of a client's desire for, and capacity to use, help."

A distinction is made between casework treatment and psychoanalytic treatment, with the preventive aspect of casework treatment being stressed. The question of whether family agencies should seek and accept appropriations from Mental Health Act funds is discussed and a suggested policy guide given for agencies expecting to do so. Emphasis is given to the need for greatly increased family-centered services of treatment and prevention in the community mental health program.

For too long the family has been ignored in social planning and has been called upon to take up the slack in a poorly integrated social order.

War affects children differently depending upon at least three aspects of a child's experience: (1) where the war is in relation to a child; (2) what war does to his family; (3) what kind of child he is. That the well-being of an infant is inextricably tied to the well-being of the mother is recognized in the suggestions given for war-time services to children. The effect of war on the school child and the adolescent is also discussed. Recognition is given to the responsibility of the federal government for developing war plans for children.

Because of the tendency to involve several members of a family one should not assume that this provides an adequate frame of reference. He points out that "unless dynamic determinants can be located, such counseling very readily becomes synonymous with psychotherapy, demanding the same experience level and time consumption." The fact that a family problem exists suggests that it is often projected on a particular person. This fact, if properly utilized, should be of therapeutic value.

The use of techniques to prepare the patient for such treatment is therefore indicated. Other patients may come to an agency expecting that other more intensive treatment will not be necessary. It is, therefore, necessary to utilize a prepsychiatric treatment counseling service to aid the individual in recognizing his need for such help outside of the agency's scope and to prepare him to get the maximum values for such treatment.

State Training School between April, 1943, and March, 1946, were studied and compared with a control group of 98 non-Puerto Rican delinquent boys, in relation to: percentage of delinquents in comparison with the proportion of the group in the whole population; family and economic background; physical conditions; psychological test scores; and types of delinquent activities. The proportion of Puerto Rican delinquent boys to their total number in the community appears to be higher than the delinquency rate of other ethnic groups. However, Puerto Rican delinquency, on the whole, is of a milder type. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

The relatives who attended were more likely to be related to psychotic than to neurotic patients. 80% of them said they were helped by the meetings. Attendees tended to emphasize the support gained from the meetings; they felt they understood mental illness better and could adjust better to their patient relatives; they developed confidence in the ability of the hospital to serve as a treatment rather than as a detention center; the group feeling that resulted proved reassuring since it enabled them to enjoy the company of other similarly situated relatives.

While 40% of those who entered the agency profited measurably from the counseling, this is no indication that the counseling was proving effective. Positively related to success in counseling were (1) desire of both parents and boy for help, (2) absence of serious emotional maladjustment either among the parents or in the boy. Apparently the main service of the agency was to fill the lack created by inadequate family relations and home life. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Some of the children of the study were selected for nursery care on the basis of the need to improve their mother's emotional attitudes. This proved unsuccessful. The mothers either did not bring their children to the nursery or withdrew them before therapy had been accomplished. If the desire is to change the mother's attitudes it is best to treat her directly rather than try to mould her indirectly through care given the child in the nursery. In cases of home difficulties it is better therefore to admit children to the nursery not on the basis of the mother's need for change but on the basis of the child's need and the ability of the nursery to help him.

AB- 30 children, who had been restored to health by the Blalock-Taussig (blue baby) operation, were studied to ascertain the factors that were related to post-operative social adjustment. While such factors as age of weaning and tendency to have friends prior to the operation were both related to adjustment, the effects of these and similar considerations on the child's adjustment were traced eventually to the kind of maternal attitudes they reflected.

AB- As a rule, mothers work because of economic necessity. The personal problems and attitudes of working mothers are not qualitatively different from those of mothers who do not work; difference, when they do exist, can be traced to the pressures in daily living created by working and absentee management of the home. Even those who do not recognize or complain of their problems feel these pressures. Although substitute arrangements are made for managing the home, the family's interpersonal relations reflect the resulting pressures. In some cases the mother's absence from the home intensifies pre-existing problems; and, in a few rare instances, the working women appeared to be absenting themselves from home in an effort to escape uncomfortable family situations.

The professional must place his emphasis upon objectives above and beyond the meeting of immediate problems. Likewise the "respect for the nature of voluntary association in our society" are held to characterize the professional. There are limitations in the function which he must understand in carrying out his work. His role as both a community and professional leader is stressed.

By providing a period of three months for the beginning period of placement, the parent is able to decide whether he wishes to go through with placement or not.

It is pointed out that there may be circumstances when it is in the best interest of the sibs to do otherwise. Hurvitz points out, "whether separation of siblings are planned because of internal reasons based on psychological needs or exigent because of external reasons, it is important to help children retain relationship with their siblings or to achieve a better relationship with their siblings."

Because this is true and therefore cultural factors play such an important role in the interpretation of the individual, the author states, "it is hoped that cultural perspectives will find a recognized place not only in specialized courses and field work projects, but will permeate the total curriculum" in social work training.

Other problems evolving out of resettlement of immigrants, family and child care services, employment and vocational counseling, and the acculturation of the immigrant are discussed.

AB- The author presents a family case in which marital problems and parent-child relationship problems are present. The marital problems were dealt with first so that the parents could later turn their attention more effectively to their relationship with the child. Through the medium of this case Shapiro points out the value of solving or bringing about a resolution of the marital problem before taking on the parent-child relationship in order that parents be prepared to focus properly. When parents cannot bring themselves to deal with their own problems first, there is still a need to at least procure a brief orientation before beginning the resolution of their difficulties.

AB- Holding that, "the length of treatment will depend on an evaluation of all the factors involved, made as carefully as possible," Knoepfmacher indicates that the length and type of treatment in a child guidance clinic depends upon (1) the strength and power of the disturbance of the mother; (2) how much of this disturbance is focussed in and projected on the mother-child relationship; and (3) the integration and functional status of the mother. Similar evaluations of the child are necessary to ascertain his requirements as to time and treatment. Two cases are cited. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Parent-child counseling as practiced in the JCSQN "consists of three distinct but interrelated processes of mother, father and child, each of which has its focus in the relationship of the one to the other two and all of which are dependent on the others for the achievement of the common goal, a change in the total parent-child relationship." Hofstein describes the methods and techniques by which counseling is proferred in such a frame of reference. The use of time-structuring is basic to the process. This, plus the common purpose and common continuing focus are held to be instrumental in coordinating the program so that the family constellation is held intact and finishes their counseling process simultaneously. Illustrative case material is included. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

The establishment by social work agencies of a termination time limit is of value to therapist and client in making an optimal adjustment to life. The relationship of this point of view to the Rankian concept of the Kronos complex is elaborated upon and forms the basis for the author's point of view.

Hence may be explained the lack of attention paid to human factors in Indian industry. The author discusses a number of ways familiar to the Occident in which the welfare and efficiency of industrial workers might be improved in India: medical personnel attached to factory to reduce absenteeism; air-conditioning; selection of workers; vocational guidance; rest periods; safety measures; music while working; ventilation, etc. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

The way the superego of the girl was strengthened is described and the point is emphasized that only after the superego has been sufficiently strengthened can the neurosis of the person be worked through.

While he does not necessarily have to be expert as a practitioner, it is essential that he be completely aware of the field and its problems. While the social work executive shares with other top-level executives in other professional and business endeavors certain broad functions relative to public relations, financial control and personnel management, he must in addition have the competency required to evaluate, interpret and apply specific knowledge in social service. The author gives a somewhat detailed job analysis of an executive director's job in a social work agency based on diary records over a period of several months.

Above all there are the factors of group identification and common interests in the health, welfare and social adjustment of Jewish people in the American scene.

At the conclusion of the course, the psychologists felt that they had an increased awareness of purpose and focus in interviewing. The result was to give the patient the feeling that the psychological tests were an integral part of the whole therapeutic experience of his hospitalization and tended to remove the aura of "mystery" and "magic."

Hochauser states, "The sheltered workshop plays a limited role in the rehabilitation of the handicapped… the sheltered workshop is only part of the scheme of readjustment of the patient and his family."

When the problems are of a psychiatric nature referral is made to appropriate agencies or to private practitioners. However, when counseling of parents and/or child is indicated they are supplied by the family agency. 2 cases are cited briefly to indicate method of handling case where only the parents are counseled or when the child is seen concurrently with the parents. A final case is included which covers in some detail the handling of a case in which counseling was done intermittently with the child and the parents until both elements of the family unit were finally prepared to understand each other.

AB- In order that the social services "keep pace with the changing environment and the changing conditions" it is necessary that research techniques be developed which will allow adequate and accurate measurements of these changes. Picheny feels therefore, that "Research problems in the field of Jewish social work evolve about the following three major areas: (1) Method for obtaining objective knowledge about clientele; (2) Method for defining the need for Jewish social services and criteria for adequate standards in Jewish social work; (3) Method of measuring the effectiveness of our services and the extent to which they are meeting the specified objectives."

AB- Chein discusses and briefly outlines the modus operandi for the conduct of "action research" as a means of avoiding the characteristic sterility found in many researches that hew to the line of placing experimental design in the forefront of consideration and leaving the question of "the ultimate disposition of the research findings" for later and often for no serious consideration. To be socially useful, research must (1) deal with problems that have present social consequences, or are likely to demand solution within the near future.; (2) the results must be applicable in concrete social situations; (3) be carried out in such a way as to stimulate applications of results in practical social situations."

Various influences that affected the rapid growth of casework are discussed. The ultimate combination of treating both environmental and emotional aspects of a client's problem is the function of casework today. Close cooperation of psychiatrist and caseworker would promote more effective mental health. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Psychotherapy is characterized as different from casework in many essential points. These differential characteristics include: (1) the special content of knowledge and training required for psychotherapy, (2) the concept of "reliving" in therapy as opposed to the focus on situational clarification in casework, (3) establishment and use of transference, and (4) use of insight. From the aspect of psychotherapy and casework as separate disciplines, the author concludes that an integration of the separate procedures and techniques can become adapted to separate value systems and professional attitudes. The 2 fields can mutually support each other and respect their own uniqueness. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

Several clinical examples are presented in order to show the application of the latter concept. It is demonstrated how, with some clarification and manipulation, rather than interpretation, quite severe problems of adjustment were solved.

Their complaints regarding food, what they expected of the social agency, and job placement were on an unrealistic basis. Various symptoms are discussed which indicate extreme dependency and inability to accept mother's death. The approach for treatment is to provide an environment with objective understanding to guarantee the "acting out" of all problems, thereby directing them toward the necessary adjustment.

AB- The new needs are for foster home care which does not anticipate permanent assimilation of the child into the family, and for foster home placement in which foster parents are paid adequately for performing specified services rather than "rewarded" with the intangible satisfactions of benevolence. We now have more disturbed than orphaned or dependent children needing placement. Many require pre-placement preparation and treatment before foster home assignment. Most foster homes are ill equipped to handle them and their problems though they need the support only a home can provide. Accordingly, traditional institutional placement is usually unsuccessful. Foster home placement today demands unusually cooperative agency-forster home-child-parent relationships. The foster home shortage is in large part due to a history of poor placement which neither helped the children nor satisfied the foster home parents. Moreover, support for the foster home has been niggardly from the first. Realistically, we must establish criteria for placement, for foster home care, and remuneration and support must be in keeping with the appropriate responsibilities.

AB- The services to convalescent children in the age group from 8 to 14 years at Herrick House are designed for rehabilitation of the child following an attack of rheumatic fever. The aim of the program is to restore each child to his own fullest functioning capacity, physically, socially, emotionally, and educationally. Interpretation of physical disability and the acceptance of limitations is important in relieving the child of his anxiety about his condition and effecting a satisfactory pattern for living.

AB- The distinct needs of the child resulting from his weak ego organization, the basic narcissistic quality of his libido, and the surface nature of his unconscious brought about the important development of activity group therapy. Play therapy serves not only as a means of communication but also as self-expression, the effect of which is fundamental change in personality structure. Improvements through threatment are demonstrated by several abstracts from selected cases. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- The author examines the typical promotional activities of social work agencies in their approach to public relations. He concludes that effective community support for case work services and agencies requires not advertising but a two-way communications process in which the community and agency identify with each other. Social workers therefore "must orient" themselves "to acceptance of the community's active partnership in the community relations process."

AB- After distinguishing the fields and functions of case work, counseling, and psychiatry, the author describes the growth and integration of private psychiatric treatment as a part of an agency's service. In this teamwork arrangement, the case worker assumes responsibility "for all that pertains to the family environment and maintains and follows through on contact with those members of the patient's family who are directly affected by the treatment being offered. For the treatment interviews themselves, only the psychiatrist can be responsible. The nature of the treatment, however, is mutually agreed upon—it is, in a very real sense—agency treatment." The problems of agency-psychiatrist relationships are discussed. Two case histories illustrate the nature of the working relationships involved. Discussion by Ruth Fizdale, Fredericka, Neumann, Samuel Richard Rosen, and Wilfred C. Hulse. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- This is a report of the Joint Distribution Committee's activities in meeting the needs of European Jews for cash, food, and clothing, care of children in institutions, day nurseries and foster families, care for the aged, and summer camps for children. From VE Day through 1946 efforts were concentrated on meeting the primary needs of the million and a half European Jewish survivors. During 1947 although much direct relief needed to be provided, education, reestablishment of organized family and community life, and arranging resettlement or emigration to Israel assumed importance in the work of the J. D. C. The stabilization of standards, building of local agencies, case work, and meeting the growing and pressing needs of the aged required especial J. D. C. attention during 1948. "Today, thanks to the cooperative efforts of many organizations—local, national and international—and the generous contributions of Jewry in many lands, no Jew in Europe need go hungry or be without shelter, no child need roam the streets, no DP camp is without special supplies to make life more livable."

AB- The refugee client "may have little or no choice in the coming, the community to which he is sent, or the agency. Nor—and this is equally important—has the agency really chosen to work with him in the way that it does with its usual clientele." The client is likely to have difficulty in accepting the limits of the help the agency can provide. Resulting disappointment that he is not to be completely taken care of may often times result in fear, hostility, and aggression." Therefore, the agency must combine its casework role with its relief role in helping the client to not only maintain his eligibility for agency financial assistance but also, by so doing, to gradually enable him to become independent and "to meet his problems in his own way."

AB- Meeting the basic financial need of the family is the responsibility of the public agency. What financial assistance, if any, should the private family agency provide? The author discusses the dilemma posed by the limited resources of the private agency to do a case work job, the insufficiency of public agency maintenance support, and the case work client in need of funds. In many cases the value of case work is endangered by the difficulty clients have in understanding and accepting the agency's inability to give them financial assistance. In the author's judgment such assistance should not be offered on the basis of assessing simple immediate financial need but is better determined by how much limited financial help will enable the clients and clients' families "to bring about a change in their situation—to work toward achieving a 'more stable and independent way of living'."

AB- "The wants of older persons are the wants of all of us" but older people in our changing society are progressively less able to fulfill their needs. No longer can responsibility be either legitimately or successfully placed on the adult children to provide for the welfare of their aged parents, even when they try to assume it. Planning for the aged must be done with them, must not overlook their capacities and individuality, and requires recognition of their physical and psychological wants. The casework agency deals with many personal and family problems which involve the aged and their adult children. Many problems grow out of the burden of the aged upon the young and the community's making displaced persons out of the aged. Even though community resources for the aged are inadequate, best use of them and resolution of family tensions and difficulties arising out of the related conflicting needs of parents and children and their families are an especial responsibility of the family case work agency. The author presents a lengthy example showing how specialized approaches in counseling combined with intelligent use of public services improved family relationships and assured the future of an elderly parent.

The first principle in their social adjustment is not so much their adjustment to society as society's adjustment to their needs and abilities. Among mentally deficient children 3 levels: idiot, imbecile, and moron, together with the sublevels of each, must be distinguished, abilities at each level must be recognized, and differential educational provisions must be made in accordance with the respective levels and their capacities. A schema is provided by the author to aid in these connections. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

Including mental defectives, psychotics, and psychoneurotics it is estimated that there are 6 million cases but that the total number of beds available for their care is less than 10,000 distributed in 20 public institutions. No provisions at all are made for mental defectives. Only about 6 psychiatrists are available in India who have had adequate training in psychological medicine. The effect of the declaration of independence on psychiatry in India has been to increase a sense of self-respect in every Indian which is essential to prevent nervous breakdown; the appointment for the first time has been made of an eminent Indian physician as chief of all medical services; an Indian Psychiatric Society has been started. The refugee in rapidly changing communities of India has become a problem in mental health for the Indian State. Recent advances in treatment of mental patients in India are reviewed. In this connection greatest progress appears to have been made at Bangalore. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

Group living and group interaction should be an integral part of the treatment plan for the majority of intramural and clinic patients… . There are three basic types of group therapy with modifications of the same. These are play group therapy for young children, activity group therapy for children in the latency period, and interview group therapy for adolescents and adults." Each of these is described and discussed. Although "therapy groups need to be kept apart from the ordinary social groupings, group therapy on an interview basis or group analysis," can even under limited institutional conditions "… benefit many who are inaccessible to or unresponsive to individual psychotherapy… . Such results, however, can be achieved only where a high degree of vigilance is exerted and the criteria for choosing and grouping patients are thoroughly understood and rigidly applied."

AB- In the two year period 1946-48 about 1,000 Jewish non-familied young people (the majority 17 to 18 years of age) were admitted to the U.S. and have been provided for and supervised by social agencies. Experience reveals that these agencies confront the problem of how better to "use existing resources for housing, education and vocational training, employment, recreation, and medical care or how to create new resources" to provide for these difficult clients, for it is clear that they need some sort of individualized "protective placement." In general these clients are negative, demanding, uncooperative, unsocial (except with other concentration camp survivors), exploitive, and unrealistic in planning. They require concerted and prompt counseling and guidance to a much greater extent than originally foreseen. A sample study in New York City revealed that three-fourths were in serious need of guidance with problems of personality and attitudes; 70% needed vocational retraining and planning; 60% were in need of Americanization and schooling; 40% needed medical attention and the same percentage needed dental care. For the group as a whole "one-third to one-half of the initial placements with relatives have not lasted." (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

Supervisory functions are best carried out by developing understanding of the functions of supervision, proper use of conferences and staff meetings, and through handling cottage parents as teams which are in frequent and sympathetic communication with the supervisor regarding team or cottage problems in a give-and-take professional relationship.

KP- TREATMENT METHODS
AB- Remarks on the papers by Slavson (see 23: 2277) and Hulse (see 23: 2249) and a brief discussion of the dynamics of group therapy, emphasizing the need in group therapy for the "involvement of the members in strongly affective activities, so that basic emotional conflicts will be spontaneously awakened" but short of "potential gratification and stimulation of undesirable wishes, through the group,… such as to excite them beyond control." In general "whether group or individual therapy is indicated in a specific case… depends on: first,… whether or not a child… is interested in the group activity or his interest can be expected to awaken in and for the group, or whether the child needs gratification from an individual relationship… in which he has not to compete with others. Secondly, it depends on the anxieties to be expected in the group or in individual relationship, respectively… . A third factor is… whether or not conflicts that need to be solved can be expected to be restimulated and resolved in either the group or individual situation directly or at least indirectly."

AB- From his extensive experience with group psychotherapy the author summarizes his views and conclusions regarding the practice and effectiveness of group psychotherapy within an outline covering "eight practical points—selection of patients; leadership and the group therapist; optimal and maximal size of groups; analytic, didactic or inspirational techniques; frequency and duration of sessions, duration of treatment; continuous groups of fixed groups; combinations of group and individual psychotherapy; and training, supervision, and evaluation of group sessions." He believes "that group psychotherapy is an outstanding weapon in the treatment of mentally disturbed persons and of social ills that in their turn cause greater disturbances in groups and individuals." 14 references.

"Both group work and case work have similar goals, both… necessitate an understanding of the dynamics of human behavior in terms of both the individual and the group, both… "require professional self-consciousness in… relationship to the people served, both recognize that this relationship… is the core of what is done, and both disciplines operate in relation to an organizational setting which defines the extent of operation of the services to be given. The similarities and differences are discussed in their process implications for although both case and group workers "need the same kind of understanding of human beings and how they function, [they] differ in how they use this understanding."

AB- The American relative (the client) "is motivated and driven by conscience [and] comes with terrific guilt and anxiety;" almost never is his need developed out of any acquaintance or personal relationship with the displaced person about whom he is concerned. The case work "problem" is to "relate the client to the reality of the relative and the situation as well as the responsibilities that will follow his migration to this country." The counseling process must assure the client of the worker's and agency's sharing of his acute concern and feelings before the reality phase can be attained wherein the client can be brought "to realize that in bringing a relative to the United States he is bringing not his projection but a real person… Realistic planning depends also on the knowledge that the rescue of the refugee is not dependent on the client's assuming full responsibility for him and that he does not, therefore, have to take this responsibility unless there is a realistic basis for it in the actual relationship he has with his relative or in his actual willingness and ability to help him in tangible ways… Since for most clients a sharing of responsibility with the agency is closer to their true ties to the relative, this knowledge helps to relieve the pressure of their conscience and prevents them from going off on quixotic ventures."

KP- CULTURES & CULTURAL RELATIONS
AB- Four handicaps stand in the way of giving genuine service to the displaced person immigrant client, his cultural strangeness to the worker, the worker's cultural bias which "is reinforced by the group the worker belongs to and appears in the guise of some social norm," and the worker's feeling of guilt toward the client as a member of a group "toward which we all feel, actively or passively, moral responsibility." The worker must realize that the "client needs help to face his phantasy before he can get involved in dealing realistically with the differences between the new society and himself." These differences include, differences in "social form," in "human relationships," and in "social philosophy." Many clients "dealt with the punitive reality [of concentration camp life] not because they accepted the crime but for purposes of survival," other accepted the guilt but not the punishment, and, finally, there are clients who accepted both guilt and punishment. Effective case work with any displaced person must successfully cope with the intrinsic handicaps, demonstrate complete acceptance of the client, altogether, with his strengths and weaknesses rather than in terms of the latter alone, involve understanding of the particular importance of giving service to the client in terms of his predominant pattern of reaction to his concentration camp experience.

A particular method of helping families confronted with marital discord is set forth in a long illustrative case in which referral was from Court to family agency in which the author underscores "some of the general difficulties that face any client and social worker in trying to resolve a marital conflict" in any agency setting.

AB- Activity group therapy and group analysis are described briefly. In discussing the dynamics of group therapy the advantages pointed up are that (1) the group re-creates a family setting, (2) transference is diluted by relationships with other members of the group, and diminishes anxiety, (3) the psychotherapist can observe the patient in the process of interaction in a group setting, (4) an expression of difficulties is made easier by group participation, and (5) it affords economy of time and personnel. The limitations of group therapy are that it is a more superficial type of therapy and cannot deal directly with deeply repressed unconscious conflicts.

AB- The attempt to devise a dependable measure of the results of casework resulted in 2 instruments with known reliability: Distress-Relief Quotient, and a scale for judging movement. They are described and the criteria for movement are examined. The author anticipates that further work may make it feasible and relatively inexpensive to incorporate such judgments in statistical reports of any agency. The results of follow-up study are necessary before the validity of these measures can be known. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- The importance of correct diagnosis in the early stages as to whether the problem is in marriage as against a marital conflict is stressed. Effective treatment in either environment or personality cases begins with the establishment of a therapeutic relationship on the diagnostic base. The case-worker's skill must include specific qualities of personality and attitude in addition to knowledge and technical understanding in order to make possible the development of this relationship.

If trainee-graduates are to be employable and find opportunities for work, the training programs must be brought into line labor market conditions and trends.

AB- Some 28% (195,000) of the Jewish population of Palestine is below the age of 15. 63% of all Jews live in Jerusalem, Tel-Aviv, and Haifa while only 20% (not all agricultural) is rural. The many Oriental Jewish communities (22% of the population), having a birth rate twice that of European Jews, "are, as a rule, relatively backward in their mental development, mode of life, social, and educational structure" and are predominantly slum dwellers. "… the proportional number of maladjusted and delinquent children in Palestine is considerably higher than in European countries or in the United States (… if we compare relatively normal periods)." Considering these salient features of the situation, the author discusses comprehensively the scope and organization of present services. The need for and necessary aims of an adequate program are stressed with emphasis placed on provision of child care and education on a national basis for all which must be geared to eliminate the prevailing cultural conflict between Oriental and European Jewish ethnic groups.

AB- 30 cases taken from the files of the Bureau of Child Guidance of the New York City Board of Education were studied. There were 18 girls and 12 boys ranging from kindergarten to seventh grade and in IQ from 79 to 154. Stated fears centered around the school or teacher (16 cases), other children (6 cases) and of something happening to the mother (4 cases). 23 children were withdrawn but 19 were willful and demanding toward their parents. Symptoms tended to involve mother-centered fears. In 9 cases the basis for the problem seemed to be in the parent-child relationship while in 17 more this relationship was an important factor. Treatment was considered successful in 9 cases, unsuccessful in 8. The more intelligent children in kindergarten or first grade who do not completely dominate their mothers seem more amenable to treatment. Boys responded better than girls but also had more of the above characteristics. Early attention to getting the child back in school seems important.

AB- Jewish observances and practices of parents, and of prospective foster children and parents have not received proper consideration in child care case work. The average case worker presumably has adequate case work training and skills but less often, since it is not specifically required, do workers have a working knowledge of Jewish customs and practices. In such cases the supervisor must, in view of the importance of these elements in a wise placement, sympathetically outline to the worker those unique Jewish factors requiring understanding and evaluation for placement most likely to bring about family integration. Several examples are included illustrating how this has been done. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

Among the developmental factors in the structure, it is pointed out that temperament and intelligence are the important constitutional elements. The significance of this is the important bearing it has on the choice of treatment methods. The main differences in methods lie in the emphasis on: (1) confidence, interviews, and slow, patient procedure for the oppressed client; and (2) authoritative, educational action for the undisciplined client.

Interviews were informal and aimed at explaining the clinic, reassuring the patient, and gathering pertinent case history information. Patients tended to welcome the information and reassurance.

AB- "The institution for the aged is no longer a custodial institution. It is a therapeutic agency for both social and medical therapy… it must have a firm professional and social community plan." The central bureau or council for the care of the aged can best develop an inclusive community program. The role of the family agency is emphasized in determining the need for or suitability of institutionalization. Cooperation between hospitals and institutions for care of the aged both improves medical care and provides unusual opportunity for longitudinal studies of the diseases of the aged. Close collaboration with public agencies and assistance programs results in more efficient use of public funds by voluntary agencies in the care of the aged. The author feels that the recreational, occupational, group membership, and status needs and desires (on an individual basis) can best be determined by drawing upon the resources of a group work agency operating within the institution. All agencies in the community must share in the responsibility for the care of the aged. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

Cooperation with concerned social agencies is helpful but in every case the institution should provide the community pattern for the care of the aged. The formation of a community wide coordinating council for consideration of the problems of the aged under the leadership of the institution is urged.

A check list of 173 characteristic items which was thought to have a relation to work adjustment was developed. 80 cases were studied representing a cross section of the case load of the service center. The highlights of the findings show that people take their early family experiences and attitudes with them to their jobs and react to their work accordingly.

AB- Jewish vocational problems are best handled by Jewish agencies because while they broaden the field of occupational choices they can do so with the advantage of a large background of experience and knowledge of discriminatory training and employment practices. The Jewish client because of his minority status brings problems to the agency which are oftentimes only incidentally vocational. The authors believe that "for many persons the feeling of being 'at home' in their own Jewish agency has been therapeutic beyond the professional services they have sought." Five case histories are given to illustrating the scope of the functions in Jewish agency vocational counseling. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Basis for this discussion is the work done with veterans at the Mental Hygiene Clinic of Los Angeles. During the intake process the psychiatric social worker should be considered a part of the entire psycho-therapeutic relationship. His own personal relationship and feelings should not interfere with his interpretations of what the patient needs. Emphasis is placed on the ability to obtain a true clinical picture of the patient and to estimate the ego strength of the individual for psychotherapy.

The author concludes that casework treatment is usually unsuccessful but the family agency is the logical type of setting for a marriage counseling service for cases of this type.

To be most effective, treatment should include both direct play procedure with the children as well as casework with the parents. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

There was found to be a similarity of background, of geographical movement, of traumatic experiences, of defense reactions for survival, and of the resultant behavior pattern which comprised the "characteristic" adolescent. The author describes typical factors of both the characteristic adolescent boy and girl. Group therapy with the children showed satisfactory results. Improvement was manifest in the decrease of tension and anxiety, and in the evidence of an increase of strength and stability. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

Factors associated with unsuccessful cases were I.Q.'s below 60, no sense of problem on part of client, and little affection for children. Least successful objectives were budgeting and proper child care. Half of the cases required no financial assistance. The author concludes that case work with such a group is worthwhile.

Success was associated with a friendly and outgoing attitude, previous good relationship with an adult, cooperative attitude toward treatment, and good ability to form a relationship with the caseworker quickly. Lack of success was associated with inability to make friends, generalized aggression, withdrawing, and a vague idea on the part of the client as to why he went to the agency.

The course of treatment is further jeopardized when the parent responds to the changing behavior of the child with anxiety and rejection. The author discusses the desirability of a treatment process which emphasizes the importance of this critical phase in the therapeutic situation, and cites the techniques by which it enables the client to express deep-lying feelings without undermining the parent-client-worker relationship.

A typical case is described to show the advantages of counselling structured to conform to the realities of family organization. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Because of a shortage of personnel, individual case work interviews with recent immigrants, chiefly displaced persons, had to be scheduled from 6 to 8 weeks apart. In the attempt to maintain level of service for the clients, bi-weekly group meetings were arranged for them with the leadership of a group worker. The role of the leader (subordinated in all circumstances to the case workers') was that of keeping alive and facilitating the clients' case work relationships between individual interviews. These group meetings provided exchange of information, focussed individual aims with reference to agency responsibilities, and, in general, strengthened client-worker relationships. Group interaction reduced "psychological isolation," enhanced group membership support, helped clients work through hostilities toward case workers, and enabled the clients to accept the limits of agency responsibility for their welfare by recasting their wants and needs in social as well as personal terms. Illustrative case material is included. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Consideration is made of the influence of psychological phenomena upon the body; of the cultural influences; and of the influence of physiological factors upon the psyche. The psychological phenomena are seen to be comprised of 5 factors (1) hysterical symptoms which solve the individual's conflict temporarily; (2) physical activity which is the result of conscious or unconscious attitudes or desires; (3) vascular, gastrointestinal, and pain syndromes which are the result of frustrations; (4) conditioning of an illness with a psychological experience; and (5) the direct result of treatment in medicine. With respect to cultural factors, the author concludes that psychosomatic symptoms are the result of middle class ideology and are also to be found among individuals who are in the state of culture change. The physiological factors that affect the psyche are demonstrated to be external appearance; the limitation of function following injury or disease; and the relationship between specific glands and behavior. 14 references.

AB- The importance of diagnosis as a continuous process in marital problems is stressed. The treatment plan depends upon a tentative diagnosis based on the attitudes of both clients, their present situation, the history of the marriage, and their personalities as expressed in their marriage. For adequate interpretation, a knowledge of the psychological determinants of behavior and an understanding of the mores and the religion of groups are essential. Treatment may be modified as new material comes to light or as a testing process alters the diagnosis. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Function of an agency is the community defined responsibility of an agency whereas service is its specific activities. Clear professional thinking requires agency differentiation of its services from those performed by other agencies. Failure to do so has resulted in lack of clear-cut intake policies, duplication of services, and in much counseling not immediately related to clients' needs or agency goals. The author believes that "those conditions which apply to Jews as a group cannot be eliminated by a private, specialized agency with limited resources" and are "a general community responsibility." The J.V.S. provides services for the vocationally handicapped; personal, physical, or psychological disabilities which are employment "obstacles over and above the 'normal' kinds of problems which Jews face in making vocational adjustments."

AB- In non-agency fee-charging camps eligibility is based on inability to pay. This arrangement has proved unacceptable to many non-agency affiliated families of low income who can use and need camp services. The Centralized Camp Application Bureau is open to all. Applicants are screened and camp needs of the individual child and facilities are matched. The results of intake worker's interviews parent and child together with relevant personal information including medical examination findings are used in placement. This information is transmitted to the selected camp to acquaint the staff with the newcomer. Staff visits are made to the camp to check on the child's adjustment. Reports from the camp are reviewed in connection with intake summaries and parents are invited to discuss the child's experiences. Thus, where the need exists the non-agency affiliated clients are guided to appropriate agency services. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Recent Jewish refugees between the ages of 16 and 20 generally come within 2 categories: those much like pre-war immigrants, and those young people who have survived concentration camp experience. The latter have lost their families, have too early had adult self-responsibility thrust upon them, and in their formative years have lived in a hostile, rejecting, and depriving physical and social environment. Distrust, denial of self-expression, and hostility toward authority were essential to survival. Such behavior hinders wholesome adjustment here. The agencies' responsibility is centered in the help it should give in resolving their "basic struggle… to find a balance between authority and freedom." Often the only haven of security for the recent refugee is his agency relationship. The conflicts, negativisms, aggressions, confusions, anxieties, and cultural naiveté of these young people are discussed in their case work implications. Topical attention is given to relating the client positively to the agency, establishment of living arrangements, school and employment placement, religious training, management of finances, and the role of resident relatives.

AB- Initiation of vocational guidance for adolescents was undertaken to fulfill a community need (not otherwise provided for) and to draw the higher socio-economic group members of the community into a cooperative relationship with the agency without the fear of charity "stigma." The experiences of a small experimental program provided the basis for expansion of this service along group work lines. By so broadening the Agency's services not only was the community better served but also the way was opened through vocational guidance for referrals leading to diagnosis and treatment of more serious problems of personality. The article gives a general description of the methods and procedures used in establishment and improvement of this type of family agency service.

AB- When the worker can be helpful in the first interview, "evidence of something started and of the worker's potential helpfulness is a positive force exerted against the many natural pulls the client has against yielding to them and pulling out." If the parent brings the problem, the child is threatened and likely to refuse or resist the agency relationship. Comparable difficulties with parents occur when the child initiates the contact. Full recognition of these feelings must give way to objective orientation in the parent-child relationship. Both parent and child need to be involved constructively. A lengthy report illustrating pertinent techniques in improving deteriorated parent-child (father-daughter) relationships is given and evaluated in terms of case progress. The authors state that where hostility, rupture of communications, and projection of blame are aggravated, best results obtain when the load is not carried by a single worker.

AB- During the war there occurred an arbitrary shift in attitudes toward adolescents away from lengthening the time of dependence and parental, home, and school supervision. Acceleration of maturity was thrust upon young people and their newly defined roles, as soldiers, industrial workers, etc., provided recognition, a sense of belonging, and adult satisfactions. Problems resulting from premature adult responsibility during the war have been followed and aggravated by attempts to reinstate ante-bellum controls over adolescents. The special problems of adolescents have been largely unsuccessfully met or avoided by case work agencies due to the lack of compatibility of the adolescent character with traditional concepts and approaches used successfully with children and adults. The author states that agency responsibility must be developed to supplement school and home training and guidance. The author believes that unless more specialized services for adolescents are made available as part of a community recognition of their unique needs, that adolescents will become outstanding social casualties of the war.

AB- There is little understanding of the Jewish displaced person. Stereotyped ideas are held by American Jewry, Allied Army and UNRRA officials. D.P.'s experiences differed under Nazi regimes; concentration camps, hiding, Ghettos, Partisan "fighting" groups. The strongest and most adaptable survived. But survival abilities have hindered post-liberation adjustment, and have persisted under Allied control as a result of continued disillusionment and homelessness. Many are "bitter to the rest of the world." The ex-concentration camper has only shreds of personal life left and neither understands nor is understood by those who lived in hiding or the Ghettoite whose standards of conduct remained fairly intact. Those remaining in the D.P. camps are less self-sufficient, social, and rational than those who have returned to urban life. Demonstrably the Jew is a "second class" citizen officially and otherwise under Allied occupation. The majority of Jewish D.P.'s wishes to resettle in Palestine and the author states that it is there they can best "build and work for the future and feel that it is permanent." Moreover, he believes that "adjustment of the group in the occupied zones would be doomed to failure." (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

Case records should be objective and give a clear, concise picture of the client and his situation. The last point of advice is that caseworkers should make use of supervision as a teaching process.

AB- The hypothesis that our educated population is fitted to tackle the complex and sometimes obscure problems of social reconstruction by reason of their more objective and realistic thinking is the subject of investigation. 250 college students were given a simple reality-fantasy-preference story test suited to Indian conditions. Each student was given 2 incomplete stores, the second story being given 2 months after the first. The student was first asked to complete the story in his own words as he thought it would end. Then he was given two alternative endings, one of which followed necessarily from the data given in the first part of the story, the other of which was more pleasant but did violence to the data given in the first part of the story. He was asked to state which ending he thought truer, and then to state which ending he liked better, again giving his reasons. His spontaneous story ending was scored on a 5 point scale (+2 to -2) with reality thinking scored plus. The average score of about 500 story endings came to +.095, indicating that among these college students fantasy thinking is at least as strong as reality thinking. On the other hand, 66% of the students selected the reality ending as being truest while 76% liked more the fantasy ending. Of first importance is it that everything possible be done educationally to counteract this tendency to fantasy thinking on the part of the educated.

An important principle of human development that operates here is that sexual tension is heightened as affectional and dependency needs go unmet.

AB- In most institutions newly arrived prisoners are not given the opportunity of expressing their feelings or of working them out. Attitudes unfavorable to wholesome community participation and responsibility persist or become intensified during imprisonment. Though "greater and harder to bear," the problems the prisoner encounters are similar to those he knew outside. Prerelease counseling is usually inadequate to help prepare the released prisoner for resumption of life in the free community. Institutional casework has the task of meeting these needs. Frequently superficial and practical requests of the inmate-client lead through interview-therapy to the prisoner's development of the ability to seek realistic and constructive solutions to his problems. The author feels that the authoritarian, coercive, and restrictive aspects of the penal institution have unnecessarily discouraged the case worker from contributing a vital service. Proceeding "from the assumption that freedom is a relative thing," the author believes that clarification of the casework relationship is possible in this situation. Prevention of further crime and effective rehabilitation are linked with appropriate treatment services, of which casework must become an integral part.

AB- Growing awareness of the psychological life of both the individual and family has drawn the family agency into helping with personal problems. In marital counseling the function of the agency is to assist the husband and wife in attaining a tenable ground in dealing with their problem. Both partners must participate in, and accept responsibility for, agency contacts. When the marital partners relate positively to the agency, the introduction of specifics, e.g., time limits, appointments, fees, and the delimitation of the role of the case worker, averts loss of client self-esteem and stimulates self-initiated progress. In subsequent contacts, which should modify unrealistic hopes, fears, and desires, the case worker helps each partner least painfully to recognize his own role in the marriage problem. Resistance and negativism will occur in the process and must be skillfully handled by the case worker. No third party or agency can solve the clients' problem, but the marital partners may through casework be brought to a constructive understanding of their differences which will promote favorable and harmonious growth and change.

AB- The agency worker and the applicant should jointly go through the process of homestudy. When the homestudy is characterized by participation of both agency worker and applicant, the agency can best "know" the foster family and appraise its ability to co-operate with the agency and care for a child under its supervision. Moreover, the family comes to "know" the agency, prospective foster parents acquire effective understanding of their function and relate positively with the agency. Emphasis is one-sided when only the applicant is studied. Homestudy should so be conducted that the applicant is equally free to reject the agency as the agency has traditionally been in a position to reject the prospective foster family. Tentativeness, mutuality, and minimization of "red tape" are essential to fruitful homestudy. An illustrative case report with analytical comment is included.

AB- The building of multiple loyalty to the various groups to which a person belongs is the fundamental task of Jewish education. The problem of avoiding internal conflict in the process is common to Jews and non-Jews alike, though underprivileged groups are more handicapped in achieving integrated multiple loyalties. Radke's study of two groups of Jews, university students and Zionists, showed the former believed Jews had 50% more negative characteristics than positive, while the latter showed an over-all positive balance. The first group more often than the latter exhibited unfavorable attitudes toward Jewish education. The author generalizes that "… a Jew who gets nothing positive from his being Jewish, or for whom the only positive side is meaningless and valueless belongingness is not a very happy one." To meet the need Jewish education must move from the "level of well-sounding generalities" to dealing with specific daily problems; it must also be "warm and joyous, something that the child is glad to accept rather than is compelled to go through with, and against which he inwardly rebels."

AB- Jewish education places much emphasis on group values to the neglect of individual development. Personal values deserve consideration beyond the "defensive" and "protective" goals of eliminating feelings of inferiority, self-hate, and self-depreciation. Jewish education should help the Jew identify with his historic traditions, enable him to empathize with Jews scattered around the world, heighten aesthetic sensitivity to Jewish culture, and create fellowship by participation in religious rites and customs. Moreover, it should aid him in developing a personal philosophy. Jewish education should be reviewed in the light of such criteria and modified to achieve these goals. It is not to be expected, however, that standardization of training will become complete, since it is a matter of differing personal opinion as to what is regarded as the "ideal American Jewish person."

AB- Institutional or foster home care of Jewish children should provide Jewish as well as secular education. The child needs to identify with the culture of his parents, consequently Jewish values in relation to the norms of the larger community should be imparted to the child. Both authoritarian parental control and failure to provide the child with an understanding and the meaningfulness of Jewish differences lead to conflict and to rejection of the parents, especially the father, or of Jewishness, or of both. The author believes that desire for intermarriage with non-Jewish persons represents an attempt, stemming from persistent conflict, to reject Jewishness. Parents "must have resolved their own conflicts about being Jews… otherwise, they cannot positively express Jewishness in their own lives." Consequences of stressing the negative rather than the positive values of Jewishness and the therapeutic value of the latter are illustrated in a case history.

AB- The author discusses the problem of "the person who is suffering acute emotional disturbance, and who diagnostically is obviously in need of psychiatric treatment, but resists this and projects the role of psychiatrist on the worker." The client often feels that he has gone just about as far as he can go in seeking help when he brings his problem to the agency case worker. The worker should establish a permissive situation in which the client's fear and anxiety about seeking psychiatric help is reduced. Temporary relief often causes the client to mistake the role of the case worker. The latter must refrain from treatment, clearly distinguish to the client his role and that of the psychiatrist, and enable the client himself to seek psychiatric assistance.

AB- Few communities have recognized or prepared to meet the needs of the aged who experience "insecurity, loss of self-confidence and self-respect… loneliness, a sense of being unwanted and useless." The agency with which the author is affiliated believes that casework agencies must expand their services to this numerically increasing group. To the extent that the client has the ability to manage his own affairs, he must be helped to use it in adjusting to his age handicaps. The client should take an active part in his own request for assistance and in the planning to meet his needs. That the casework relationship may be the only stabilizing and satisfying "constant" in the life of the aged client is a challenge to the agency. Considerations in the provision for medical care, relief, domicile, clothing, etc. are discussed with reference to the individuality of the client. Proper use of leisure time and the importance of adequate diet are among the most neglected problems of the aged. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

These are (1) "exploration" of one's own attitudes toward minority groups and individuals; (2) "recognition" of one's patterns of behavior and their effect on relationships with others; (3) "evaluation" of what the patterns mean in terms of motivation; and (4) "utilization" of increased awareness to adopt new patterns or to reinforce constructive patterns already established. The need for analysis is evident from records disclosing biases in the realm of race. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- The five types of cerebral palsy and their approximate relation in percentages are: spasticity, 40%; athetosis, 40%; ataxia, 10%; rigidity, 5%; and tremor, 5%. The mentality of children with cerebral palsy has been found to be good in 75% of the total. Mental deficiency, when present, is usually found in the spastic and rigidity groups. The 6 fundamentals of treatment are physical, occupational, speech, brace, drugs, and surgery. Cerebral palsy cannot be cured, but guidance, treatment, and education should attempt the most complete rehabilitation possible. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Case records of 49 unmarried Negro mothers living in Washington, D. C. were reviewed. Guilt was more evident in middle than in the lower social class and tended to be negatively correlated with the acceptance of the illegitimate pregnancy by the client's family. Promiscuity was less acceptable than illegitimate pregnancy. More than three-fourths of the cases accepted illegitimate pregnancy with little or no evidence of guilt over violating a moral code. General emotional adjustment was unrelated to attitude toward illegitimacy. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

As in other studies, treatment success was found to be related to a parent's willingness to accept parallel treatment and capacity to use it. However, 5 girls improved even though their parents did not. They were distinguishable by their close ties to their mothers, by inability to express aggression toward their mothers, and by a desire for help.

AB- From a study of the records of 3,565 felons who, while on parole, were inducted into military service, it is concluded that the majority of felons can be effectively utilized as soldiers, and should be inducted if there is another war. The screening of felons before induction was not thorough enough, however, and as a group they were more troublesome than the general Army-Navy population. A higher proportion of this group was dishonorably or "other than honorably" discharged. It appears that the majority of the group, who were not psychopaths, reacted favorably to the military experience. Many were capable of heroic behavior, judged by citations awarded, and of leadership, judged by rank attained. Military service now entitles these men to vocational and educational training which may be expected to improve their future social adjustment, but it has also created a number of new social problems.

Although defeat in combat was experienced as a personal failure, he could not accept discharge from the army because he would thus lose the support and security found in the service. Discharge and return home would have forced him to revert to the role of a dependent child. The psychiatric and social therapy used is described.

In the childhood years the attitudes of the parents plays a very important part in determining degree of adjustment, but this factor becomes less important as late adolescence and young adulthood are reached."

The caseworker cannot escape the responsibility for participating actively in this decision. She must recognize that the baby is not and cannot be an answer to the mother's conflicting and neurotic needs. The success of casework lies in helping to release the mother from indecision, to find a more realistic answer to her needs, and to offer concrete ways to attain some of these satisfactions.

AB- The importance of the emotional aspect in illness is emphasized by the fact that 40-60% of all patients who go to doctors have an illness precipitated largely by an emotional disturbance. The physical examination should not be devoted solely to evaluation of physical factors. This requires that the physician be interested and adept in the method which will probe the sources of the patient's emotional conflict. The social worker's role in the doctor-patient relationship includes the capacity to help the patient participate more fully in the processes of medical diagnosis and treatment, and to have the specialized knowledge of community resources for meeting the vocational and social needs of the patient.

In this situation, it is shown that throughout the period of medical care there was a constant interchange of thinking between the doctor and social worker concerning the physical, social, and emotional factors in the patient's illness. Together, they bring to this process of helping the individual to deal with his disease and its effects upon him, all their specific professional knowledge and skills which have been greatly enriched through psychiatry and psychoanalysis.

In treating delinquency the following mechanisms need to be clarified: (1) the primary instinctual need served by the act; (2) the unconscious frustration or the inhibiting mechanisms that tend to hold this instinctual drive in abeyance; (3) the unconscious aggression against the initial perpetrator of the frustration; (4) the feeling of guilt which is invariably expressed in some part of the act; (5) punishment mechanisms set in motion by the delinquent himself; and (6) a specific set of external circumstances that periodically sets in motion the delinquent act.

Psychoneuroses, character disorders, primary behavior disorders, and neurotic traits responded well. Pre-oedipal behavior disorders, psychopathic personalities, and prepsychotic disturbances responded poorly. Other factors associated with success were punitive parents, previously inadequate social contacts, and "introverted submissive" personality traits.

These social causes of crime plus the high frequency of recidivism in juvenile delinquents mean that, in the prevention of crime, the point of attack should be not so much in adjusting individuals to society as in adjusting society to individuals. With respect to treatment of actual offenders, it is suggested that self-respect, self-confidence, and a wholesome reconstruction of their lives be encouraged.

AB- The authors study the operations of transference and counter transference in casework. Expressions of positive transference are seen to be in the use of time, changes in dress, clients' comments regarding the case worker, attempts to prove "goodness" or "badness," and repetitious demands. Negative transference is found when clients analyze and show a patronizing attitude toward the case worker. An essential part of treatment is observed to be in keeping out of entanglements and adequately managing the transference so that the social caseworking may accomplish the aim toward the increased utilization of the clients' ego strengths.

KP- INDUSTRIAL AND PERSONNEL PROBLEMS
AB- Absenteeism is defined as the unexplained absence of a worker from his job during regularly scheduled working hours. The author cites as causes of absenteeism: (1) unsuitable working conditions, such as long hours per shift, unduly fatiguing work, unsuitable temperatures, insufficient ventilation, and unscientific lighting, (2) unfavorable mental attitude arising from boredom, discontent with wages, resentment against inefficient supervisors, etc., (3) lack of provision for general welfare, and (4) inadequate medical facilities for minor injuries. The absentee rate is high in marginal workers not accustomed to steady work or regular living habits, in winter months and during the rainy season, and in women (particularly so in married women). Larger concerns have high rate of absenteeism probably due to increased distance between management and men. A program of control and prevention of absenteeism should include such measures as a careful record keeping of absenteeism and immediate check-up improvement of working conditions, first-aid facilities, interview of absentee on return to work, encouragement of worker to give advanced notice, concern for the housing of the workers, and strong moral suasion through posters, literature, and talks.

AB- In the India of the past, no clear-cut distinction was made between epileptic fits and fits of a psychological origin, i.e., hysterical fits. The author would distinguish the hysterical fit altogether from the epileptic, using the following criteria: no aura, no epileptic cry, partial (never complete) loss of consciousness, and irregular clonic convulsions indicating some symbolic significance or representing some emotional experience which the patient is reliving. Furthermore, hysterical fits involve only very minor injuries; they occur in the presence of an audience and are dramatic in nature, provoked by an emotional situation such as a quarrel; the Babinski's sign is not obtained, and reflexes are not lost but merely exaggerated; there are no postparoxysmal phenomena; the patient remembers the fit; there is no deterioration of mental functions; and it is unusual for hysterical fits to come on during sleep. Instead of removing the symptoms through suggestion, therapy consists in rebuilding the disintegrated personality. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

There was a tendency for neo-natal problems to be associated with later problems and for all problems to be associated with maternal rejection. Attendance at the clinic nursery school is considered an important treatment adjunct. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- This book contains 39 papers prepared for the 1945 meetings of the National Conference of Social Work. Three papers discuss psychiatric services for the returning veteran and his family, and another describes some general considerations on the most effective use of psychiatric consultation by a social case work agency. A paper on the treatment of juvenile delinquents discusses the origins of childhood aggressiveness and offers some suggestions for therapy. The contribution that the social worker may make to the social development (and readjustment) of the child is described, with emphasis on the total community relationship of the social worker in preference to the child guidance clinic for this type of function. Other topics of interest to the psychologist are: the unmarried mother; training practices for professional group leaders; the functional capacity of the aged and a scheme for classifying functional capacity; and techniques of social action.

AB- The city of Lincoln experienced an increase in juvenile delinquency of 57% during the war, although the number of cases in the war years was still small. The delinquents in the prewar years 1937 and 1938 and the war years 1941 and 1942 were studied in detail for personal factors, family and home conditions, school factors, nature and type of offense, and treatment by the magistrates. As a result of the findings, it is recommended that all young persons charged with indictable offenses should be given medical and psychological examinations for the guidance of the court; social service facilities should be expanded; delinquent children, and possibly younger children in the same home, should be removed from poor homes more readily than at present; additional suitable foster homes should be found; recreational facilities should be increased; better work opportunities should be provided; and methods of treatment prescribed by the courts should be reviewed from time to time.

AB- Of 100 boys who had been treated by the Worcester Child Guidance Clinic between 1929 and 1936 and were subjects in a follow-up study between 1938 and 1942, the proportion in military service (55%) was comparable to that of the same age group in the general population. Families of 42 of the men in service were interviewed in the spring of 1945 to determine the quality of adjustment to the service made by the previous patients. About as many made satisfactory as unsatisfactory adjustments. Symptoms at time of treatment were of no value in predicting adjustment to service years later. Patients who responded well to treatment and who were well adjusted at the time of the follow-up study tended to adjust better to the service than those who did not respond and/or were poorly adjusted at the time of the follow-up.

The psychiatrist is most needed for direct, and frequently intensive, treatment of the delinquents with deep personal conflicts. Other methods, such as group therapy or shop work, are discussed in relation to other patterns of delinquency. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

Poor parent-child relationships and a tendency for both parents to be unstable, even when only one is alcoholic, are considered to be important factors in limiting treatment effectiveness.

Dull children tended to present problems which were more externalized. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

If the child presented another type of problem, favorable results were largely dependent upon the mother's attitude and personality. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Case records of 25 dominating fathers and 26 children (22 boys and 4 girls) were examined. Fourteen boys were oldest children and 4 were only children. Fourteen cases were originally presented because of school problems. Motivation for domination was either compensatory gain (neurotic), consolation for unfulfilled ideals, cultural pattern of authority, or a combination of the first and last. Fifteen of the children were passive, submissive, and dependent; 6 were rebellious and resentful; and 5 were passively resistant. Treatment was most successful for children only if fathers changed also, but favorable factors were improvement in the mother-child relationship, the child's being in adolescence, or the child's being able to establish a good relationship with the psychiatrist. Fathers motivated by cultural pattern were most successful in changing their attitudes. Results with the neurotically motivated group were neglible.

AB- A series of 19 cases which were reopened for a second period of treatment were examined in an effort to determine clues for predicting which reopened cases would be helped. Improvement in the child in the first period of treatment, some insight by parents into their relationship to the problem, and a desire on the part of the parent for help were the only criteria which were at all predictive of improvement in the second period of treatment.

A sample group was interviewed again in June, 1943. Three fourths of the group made good adjustments throughout training and employment. Adjustment of the others tended to improve with work experience. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

Interviews were directed at reducing relatives' emotional tensions by explaining the social psychiatric history, the functions of the social service department, routine hospital services, and court procedures. The time and informants for the social history were selected, and relatives were given an opportunity to ask questions and talk about the patient. The interviews are beneficial to both the relatives and the hospital. Twelve case histories are given. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Eleven families treated in the Judge Baker Guidance Center were studied. All 11 mothers directed destructive aggression toward both the husband and child and provoked aggression in the children. Under treatment the mother tended to improve if her life pattern was well organized or to get worse if she was already unstable. In general, if the mother was aided by the clinic, the father became worse, and vice versa. The parent who sought clinic aid was the more likely to improve. Nine of 13 children improved under clinic treatment. In two families, both parents benefited from clinic contacts. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

Twenty fathers tended toward inadequacy, insecurity, and passivity. The majority were struggling against their passivity. Most of their wives were cool, domineering, or depreciating toward both the fathers and the children. About 75% of the fathers were difficult to work with in treatment.

AB- From the sociological viewpoint, the purpose of foreign relief and rehabilitation is to re-establish social processes in such a way that the security of nations is assured. In setting up new or restoring old institutions for the work, we should be definitely clear as to the social and psychological consequences. The author discusses implications for relief and rehabilitation operations, and shows how we can help such people to avoid pauperization and to help themselves. Some practical suggestions are presented for compilation of data in advance of operations and by persons scientifically trained. These data should cover in detail food, clothing, shelter, medical and dental services, agricultural practices, employment and business practices, family life, and community organization and attitudes.

AB- The effect of the impact of war upon the social and emotional life of children is considered. It is felt that the principle dangers to the emotional life are the disruption of routine, disturbance of emotional ties with the parents, and alteration of habitual patterns of emotional expression. It is pointed out that children at all ages have suffered from the war and have needs which must be cared for. The lack of precise information is indicated, as is shown in the conflicting reports on juvenile delinquency. Sex problems have increased, which also means a large number of unmarried mothers and unwanted babies, both presenting psychological problems. In general it is felt that the care required is the same type as that needed in peacetime, but that war requires an extension and increase in these services.

The authors suggest that social service workers be added to the staff of draft boards or selective service headquarters for the purpose of securing the needed information in regard to men who are suspected of susceptibility to mental disorders. Three series of case studies are presented as evidence. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

Although counseling operates without real authority, and technically within certain limits, there is no real limit to the scope of the problems with which the industrial counselor may deal.

AB- A very grave increase in juvenile delinquency occurred during World War I. Juvenile court statistics for these years are presented by years, sexes, and nature of offenses. It is felt that though there were many causes for an increase, three are especially clear: the changes in home life; the restriction of opportunities for elementary education; and the increase in juvenile employment and changed conditions of juvenile employment. It is also shown that the British increase, serious though it was, was not as striking as the increase in delinquency in Germany, where an added factor was present: children were left in the care of women in a nation that had little respect for women.

AB- The author finds, from a random selection of 25 cases, that a client who has made a satisfactory adjustment to his problem is nearly always the person who has attempted independently a constructive solution, although he failed and had to come to the agency for help, without undergoing any serious deprivation of his basic needs. He was able to ask for this help without undue emotional reaction. The client who has not made a satisfactory adjustment with the help of the agency was nearly always the person who had to undergo a serious degree of deprivation before coming to the agency for help, who felt upset about his need for dependency upon the agency, and who tried to use the agency for the purpose of dumping his entire problem on the case worker. It would appear, therefore, that potential success or failure can be fairly easily predicted on the basis of data obtainable in the first interview.

AB- The development, from information services and charity services, of what is now called counseling is described. Concepts of counseling in industry, the army, psychology, psychiatry, and social case work are discussed. Counselors need professional skill and education to rise above the "handout" level, for personal problems do not come in neat packages but are psychosocial in nature. Successful handling of personal problems requires an understanding of the complex relationship between the personality and the social milieu.

These functions are interpreted to be psychological prognosis and psychological research. The psychologist's duties are, therefore, testing clients by appropriate psychometric methods for the case worker, making reports of the observations, and sharing through publication with others in similar work the findings of such research.

AB- This study deals with the adjustment of 20 children 4 years after they entered kindergarten and describes changes in the group as a whole and in individual cases. The factors involved in adjustment seem to be relationships at home and in the school and the child's own capacity for growth. Among these, parental relationships are of paramount importance in the adjustment that a child makes during his first 5 years in school. The most satisfactory and sound adjustment was seen where all 3 of these factors were positive. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Great emotional significance attaches to vision and the eye, and a threat to the eyes arouses a deep emotional response. Some kind of fear underlies the attitude of the visually handicapped individual toward his treatment or condition. The author discusses at length the role of the case worker in understanding the import of the medical recommendations, the previous life adjustment of the patient, and the meaning of the illness to the patient. The case worker must strive for some form of inner reconciliation on the part of the blind individual. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- From the follow-up studies of 140 dementia praecox patients paroled after insulin shock therapy, the authors found that those who failed to adjust well in spite of favorable environmental situations and those who were able to achieve success in the face of decided environmental odds, represent only a small minority. This means then that a large majority of such patients must be helped and encouraged by a friendly and favorable reception in order to be able to take up their lives outside the hospital with satisfaction to themselves and to their family, friends, and employers. Social workers can make important contributions in this regard. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

The next step is to consider carefully what data are needed and how they are to be secured in answering the proposed question. After this is done, the research worker in case work is confronted with the problem of how to use the data meaningfully. Knowledge of sampling and of other means of avoiding bias is necessary, to be able to judge when differences are large enough to be considered significant.

Play therapy is not a definable method and requires a highly individualized approach. Therefore, it may fail to help the child overcome his difficulties if not safeguarded by psychiatric and case-work supervision. Bibliography.

AB- This paper reviews the psychological effects of war and defense activities on British children. A marked increase in juvenile delinquency, particularly in the group under 14, has occurred, with a greater percentage increase in girls than boys. From 10 to 15% of the evacuated children developed difficulties: enuresis, psychosomatic difficulties, petty delinquencies, psychoneurotic disorders, or other asocial behavior. The morale and general emotional condition of children were very good, and the effects of bombings were less than had been anticipated. In general, those who developed psychoses or neuroses had histories of previous disturbances or behavior difficulties, or were insecure in their own homes. Even very young children exhibited typical psychoses or anxiety neuroses. Children of 6 or 8 years reacted most favorably. The development of various types of placement for evacuated children is described, and general recommendations are made for similar provisions in this country. A list of specific recommendations, based on British experience, is given to meet the wartime needs of children. Particular emphasis is placed on recreational facilities and supervision.

AB- The method of predicting adolescent pre-psychotic personalities is unsound. We know that some individuals with withdrawn personalities will become schizophrenic, but this is quite different from saying that all withdrawn types are potential schizophrenics. Even more dangerous is the consequent attitude on the part of clinical practice in dealing with such behavior problems in children or adolescents. Our function should be to help them in their struggles toward maturity and adjustment rather than to put ourselves into the same restraining position as that which helped to cause the original behavior.

The study suggests that attention should be given to the early life histories, particularly to those affectional experiences sustained in the parent-child relationship. Here the psychiatric social worker plays an essential role in securing and evaluating background information. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Juvenile delinquency in Hamilton County, Ohio, has increased nearly 100% since 1927. Analysis of court records indicates 2 major periods of increase. Court records are compared with total population of juvenile court age, population and housing in the deteriorated area of highest delinquency rate, Negro population, activity of the police, the work of leisure-time and group-work agencies, the operation of 2 schools for delinquents, and general economic and relief conditions. The data indicate that the increase is due to "adverse economic and social conditions, combined at times with grossly inadequate relief during the depression period."

AB- Some follow-up studies in the readjustment of problem children suggest that their later shifts are often dependent upon intangible emotional factors. For the purpose of analytical and follow-up study, the authors took 85 cases, 50 of whom were described as unimproved and 35 as successfully adjusted at the time of closing at a child guidance clinic. The results reaffirm the hypothesis that the social and emotional development of a child depends upon the latent resources of his own personality on the one hand, and upon the attitudes of society, particularly those of his own family, that encourage or thwart the growth and maturing of his own potentialities on the other.

AB- Seldom, if ever, is a child brought to a clinic for treatment with any real understanding of his misbehavior. He may have treatment thrust upon him by the will of some adult authority or he may be brought for treatment by some deceptive means. Hence there is likely to be in the first interview a feeling of fear and humiliation which must be met and understood by the therapist in such a way that the child gradually becomes able to express his own unconscious feeling of need for treatment in the wish for a continuing relationship with the therapist.

The addition to the probation office's staff of a trained case worker who would act as a kind of intake supervisor would provide consultation services to the parents as well as to the delinquent children and would refer them to the appropriate agencies for assistance.

AB- The authors attempt to isolate cultural and personality factors involved in the attitudes of Russian Jewish clients toward requesting and accepting financial assistance, and to show how understanding of these attitudes may assist case workers in making social diagnoses. The reason for the selection of Russian Jewish clients was the unusual homogeneity in the religious ideology and the general cultural background. Their investigation shows that clients who are well adjusted adhere to the teachings and ideals of their culture, while those who are maladjusted disregard or overemphasize their culture's ideals. This latter group shows rather demanding, hostile, and dependent attitudes and lacks initiative and practicability in plans for reestablishing independence. The authors conclude that the chief value of their findings is in the diagnostic criteria they imply. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- This study traces the development of social and legal attitudes toward delinquent and problem children in Germany from 1478 to the present. The National Child Welfare Law of 1922 provided the first national basis for committing children to correctional institutions. Commitment might be voluntary or through guardianship courts. Prior to the National Socialist regime, institutions ranged from prison-like, conservative schools to very progressive and liberal institutions. The present government has re-introduced the use of corporal punishment, denied the child's right of appeal from disciplinary measures. The child is subordinate to the national policy, and treatment is directed toward cooperation in the National Socialist system. "Hereditary sick" children are sterilized, problem and mentally deficient children are committed to insane asylums. "Compulsory labor service" and army training may continue the discipline of the boy for four or five years following the training school. Probation is difficult because of large case loads and is discouraged by the government. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- The Jewish Board of Guardians, New York City, offers to unmarried mothers four alternatives with regard to the disposition of their children. These include financial assistance if needed, foster home, adoption, or supposedly temporary care in the Home for Hebrew Infants for a period up to three years. The last alternative is for those cases in which the mothers are undecided about what to do or cannot put their plans into effect immediately. 30 cases falling under this last category have been analyzed by the author to determine whether or not there were factors differentiating those who finally took their children home from those who eventually gave their children over for adoption or placement. She concludes that when four or more favorable factors (six in all) are present in a case, the child is likely to be finally taken home, while when three or fewer are present some other disposition of him is apt to be made.

Her case-study data are divided, with the aid of the interviews, into the following groups: satisfaction, 8; acceptance, 22; compulsory acceptance, 8; and dissatisfaction, 7. She finds that WPA probably fulfils its stated aims fairly adequately. However, changes in living standards make her doubtful whether the implied objective of maintaining "health and decency" is being secured.

Since 1792 the state has paid an allowance to committees or individuals for the care of "pauper idiots and lunatics." As there is no provision for psychiatric or psychometric tests, there is no way of knowing whether or not the beneficiaries are idiots. The principle of caring for this group outside of institutions is a good one, but it has not operated and will not operate effectively unless the beneficiaries are closely supervised by a competent and skilled professional staff of workers.

She found that social workers' participation is of real importance and that social workers in adult mental hygiene clinics have need of considerable training in the psychiatric aspects of case work, for whatever division of social work they happen to be doing, they must understand emotional problems in order to recognize and procure significant material or to utilize it in their own case-work treatment.

AB- Since the number of persons diagnosed as psychotic is said to be on the increase, the author investigated the work of the Family Society of New Haven, a family agency, for the fiscal year 1937, in regard to psychotic individuals and their families, and studied the effects on the other members of the family of the psychotic persons' being kept at home. The results show that the agency was a assistance in many of these cases because of the services of a psychiatrist available to the agency staff, and that on the other hand the presence of the psychotic individual at home was clearly detrimental to the adjustment of some of the other members in the family. Hence a provision of boarding home care for certain psychotics seems most desirable. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- The Oaks School is one of the few institutions in which juvenile delinquents of borderline intelligence are trained, supervised, and studied. Its aim is to develop in the boys a sense of responsibility to one another and a desire to become socially acceptable, and to develop their abilities so that they may become self-supporting. This study is a follow-up investigation of 20 boys 5 to 7 years after they left the school. "Given institutional training adapted to their emotional and intellectual needs, it would appear that perhaps as many as fifty per cent of seriously delinquent boys of borderline defective intelligence can later make a good adjustment in the community. Not only does that seem to be true, but it has been shown that a well-trained staff can predict very accurately which boys out of a group will become well adjusted and what conditions must be met to help them make such an adjustment."

AB- This investigation is based on the case records of 30 Jewish families whose children, by request of the parents, were patients of the Hartley-Salmon Clinic of Hartford, Connecticut, between January 1, 1935 and January 1, 1938. She finds that for the most part the Jewish children referred to the clinic by their parents were much like the Gentile children. However, there seems to be a factor of significant emphasis which Jewish parents attach to their children's behavior. Some of the reasons why Jewish parents find certain behavior traits disturbing are to be found in the Jewish culture, while others (and to some extent the same ones) bear a close relationship to the parents' peculiar personality traits and problems. She concludes that "behavior of any group of people cannot be adequately understood by reference to individual motivations alone." (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- This study is concerned on the one hand with the kind of cases the family agency refers to the clinic and the sorts of service requested, and on the other with the kind of service the clinic in turn gives; and finally with an analysis of the cooperative work between the agency and the clinic. The material for the study consists of 34 cases (18 girls and 16 boys) referred during 1936 and 1937 to the Hartley-Salmon Clinic by the Charity Organization Society of Hartford, Connecticut. The author concludes that the services the agency wanted most frequently were either psychiatric treatment or diagnostic study, and that the way in which the clinic gave such services in all save one case seems to suggest that the family agency had made a careful diagnosis of the child's difficulty before referral was made. The analysis of the co-operative work between the agency and the clinic shows that a close cooperation is most effective, for the clinic offers to the agency its own specialized service in regard to the treatment of children while the agency is free to work with the parents in the light of the clinic's diagnosis of the child's difficulties.

AB- The type of behavior which often follows epidemic encephalitis (irritability, temper tantrums, emotional instability, stealing, cruelty, exaggerated sexual impulses, and generally, inadequate inhibitions and anti-social tendencies) has received the name "postencephalitic behavior," but is not necessarily the result of encephalitis only. Among the children exhibiting this type of behavior who have been studied at the Child Guidance Clinic in Los Angeles, in only a few cases has a definite diagnosis of encephalitis been made. There has been found rather an interplay of factors, none purely resultant, adding together to form the personality problem. Treatment consists in understanding and careful supervision, a routine of living which is varied but firm, an individualized school program, medical attention, and specific psychotherapy where feasible. The results of treatment are successful in about 25% of the cases. It is believed that where the behavior pattern is not a result of a sudden infectious process but is a product of factors effective over a long period of time, the instances of successful treatment might be made more frequent.

She found that there was a considerable agreement between the data from her own observation and the teacher's reports to her about the children's adjustment, and that there was a very close relationship between parents' behavior toward the children and the children's adjustment to kindergarten.

AB- This is a comparative study of children of two kindergarten schools in the same city for a period of one semester. One school is definitely better equipped and is supervised by a better qualified teacher, while the other is poorly equipped and is supervised by a less desirable teacher. It was found that the two groups, while they showed very similar distribution in the various adjustment categories in the initial period, differed considerably at the end of one semester. They conclude that unfavorable attention from a teacher, if it duplicates a child's home situation, is detrimental to his adjustment; and that a teacher's favorable attitude is definitely helpful to most children, although it cannot wholly care for the needs of children who suffer severely from emotional deprivation at home.

AB- Using Dollard's definition of accommodation attitudes of negroes, the author investigated 53 negro families to determine the extent of the influence of these attitudes on case work. She found that in about a third of the total number of cases these attitudes were obstacles to case-work treatment. She states that "the actual number of cases affected by accommodative responses may have been greater than indicated here." Hence it is necessary to be aware of these obstacles if case workers are to help negro clients to make an effective use of casework services.

AB- This study is concerned with the achievements of a summer camp conducted by the Psychiatric Clinic of the Massachusetts General Hospital for children with emotional problems. The major line of inquiry in the interviews and case records of 43 children was to compare children who adjusted well in camp and afterward, children who adjusted poorly in camp and afterward, and children whose later adjustment could not be predicted from their adjustment in camp, in order to discover some definite criteria by which such a camp may be better able to select various types of problem children with an expectation of favorable results. Their findings reveal that "children who are apt to benefit from camp are those whose home situations contain some favorable factors, who feel insecure about fancied or real inferiorities to their siblings, who have been able to make some progress through treatment or who, rejecting treatment, are fairly self-sufficient children who appear to be suffering from overtly unfavorable environments."

AB- 82 delinquent boys at Berkshire Industrial Farm requested and received agricultural training at the institution. Upon completion of the training period they were paroled to farmers, under supervision of the Farm. A follow-up study shows that agricultural training is neither socially nor economically desirable for most of the boys. They have generally been overworked and underpaid, have had few recreational opportunities, and tended to leave the farms for the city upon receiving their permanent discharge. Supervision has kept most of the boys out of serious difficulties, but has not helped in the adjustment of personality problems. It is concluded that placement in a rural area may create more problems than it helps. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- 33 delinquent boys paroled from St. Charles School had received training in a wide range of vocations. With the exception of farming, this training has not been considered in the decision as to parole. By far the largest number came from inadequate homes, and when they were returned to those homes they soon got into further difficulties. The boys in foster homes were for the most part an underpaid group who had poor recreational opportunities. They had, however, adjusted themselves better than boys who were returned to their own homes. The physical well-being of the boys needed special consideration. The records which were kept, including foster-home investigations and reports of progress after placement, are quite inadequate. The whole problem of vocational adjustment needs to be reconsidered, so that the boy will have the opportunity to secure work in the trade in which he is trained while in the St. Charles School.

It is suggested that the excess number of functional mental illnesses among Jews may be related directly to environmental stress. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- "Supervision on probation is probably the wrong concept and implies the wrong approach. People, and particularly young girls, are not easily influenced when they are supervised. They do not change their habits when they feel that they are supervised. A better concept is guidance, perhaps still better is reconditioning of habits and attitudes—if we fully understand such a complex and difficult concept. The ideal, of course, is self-adjustment, self-guidance, self-reconditioning, stimulated by the probation officer and the court." (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

The author recognizes many factors possibly contributing to such situations. She analyzes and discusses such factors as age, source of referral to the agency, patients' personality traits, patients' attitudes toward treatment, parental attitudes toward treatment, parental personality traits, and reasons for children's discontinuing treatment as seen by the case workers. At the end the editor of the Studies has added a section on interrelationship of factors associated with discontinuance of treatment, based on the same data as the analytical summary.

AB- The authors attempted to answer two questions on the basis of case records. Are adolescents different from children of other ages in their response to child guidance treatment? Is there any prognostic value for success or failure of psychiatric treatment of an adolescent child in his personality traits? In regard to the first question, they found very little difference. In regard to the second question, they concluded that "a surprisingly accurate estimate of the probable results of treatment could be made from a study of certain personality traits."

KP- ADOPTION CRITERIA
KP- CHILDHOOD AND ADOLESCENCE
AB- The authors state that "Adoption practice as it now exists in Illinois is largely a legal matter, and its social implications are not fully considered. Many adoptions are effected before the Department of Public Welfare has submitted its recommendations, and if made, they are sometimes not followed." The chief concern here is to suggest certain considerations which should be taken into account, whether an adoption petitioner is "of sufficient ability to bring up a child" and the adoption "is fit and proper and for the best interest of the child." For this purpose 60 cases were selected for study from the adoption children who were examined at the Illinois Institute for Juvenile Research during the two years 1933-35. In the records of those cases it was found that the children adopted under one year old seemed more successful than those adopted above one year old. Adoptions were made mostly by persons who considered themselves unable to have children of their own. The authors feel that there should be a careful study and consultation on the part of child-placing agencies before any adoption takes place. If the motives and desires of the parents wanting children are uncovered many unsuccessful adoptions may be avoided. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- 30 cases which closed at the Worcester Child Guidance Clinic from 1935 to 1937 were divided between successful and unsuccessful treatments. Among the eight personality traits found significant as criteria, the most significant factor was the capacity to carry out plans and to make adjustments in the face of frustrations. Other important factors were a satisfactory marital adjustment, inferiority feelings, an attitude of real affection toward the child, and a normal amount of social interest. The mothers who were not successful in the treatment were lacking in the capacity to achieve goals, frequently had an unsatisfactory marital adjustment, had excessive social interest or none at all, and were often aggressive, dominating, and hostile under the cover of anxiety. They were deeply dissatisfied and restless. Helping them to gain confidence in their ability to handle situations was the most successful form of treatment.

AB- This is a compilation of theses presented by four students in social work, dealing with 185 children, mostly between the ages of 6 and 21, whose mothers were patients of the Central Islip, New York, and the Rhode Island State Hospitals. The information concerning the children's adjustment was obtained by means of interviews, observations, and discussions with the children and their relatives and friends. The authors classified the children in terms of four categories of adjustment—the well-adjusted children, the quiet, "too good" children, children with localized problems, and children with severe, generalized maladjustment. They found, among other things, that the psychotic condition of mothers is a very important factor for children's social and emotional maladjustment. Hence an adequate psychiatric service should be extended to the children of psychotic mothers to insure proper home environment and a sense of security. Several cases are cited.

Present evidence indicates that the scale could be limited to seven traits: imagination, judgment, objectivity, patience, resourcefulness, sympathy, and tolerance. "The most that can be claimed for validity, at this time, is that the scale presents in a lucid manner the personality traits judged to be essential for success in social case work by one hundred experts."

AB- A study of the extent and differentiation of services offered to children by a family agency. Of 289 cases active with the Family Welfare Association of Evanston in 1936-1937, the agency was primarily concerned with a child in 72 cases, and was primarily concerned with the total family situation and secondarily with a child's problem in 46 cases. This second group contained cases typical of situations treated by a family agency. Cases in the first group were analyzed in greater detail as to the children themselves, source of referral problems, family situation and attitudes, and methods of treatment employed. The differentiation of services to children was largely a matter of degree, ranging from cases in which the approach to and treatment of the child was closely integrated with that of the family as a whole, to the other extreme in which there was complete separation of the case work with the child from that with the family.

AB- "The chief findings of this review of 120 cases of children severely and overtly rejected by their mothers seem to lie in the statistical confirmation of the opinions of clinicians that such children are generally not amenable to child guidance treatment and in the suggestion that there are certain, fairly well-definable conditions under which such children can be helped. The cases represented the work of five clinics, all of which had a very similar distribution of successes and failures. The patients were, on the average, brighter and younger than the run of child guidance cases, and their parents, for the most part, had at least adequate economic resources… . A search for individual characteristics that distinguished the successful from the unsuccessful cases revealed… . that if a child had a high intelligence or a father who gave him some affection or—much more important—a mother whose rejecting attitude was modified during treatment his chance of successful adjustment was greatly enhanced."

State Hospital showed a code of socially prescribed behavior toward psychotic relatives. This behavior was characterized by reactions of anxiety, fear of the hospital, and refusal to recognize illness, and may have been caused by the emphasis Jewish culture places on the unity and intellectual level of the family group.

AB- The findings reported in this article deal with the opinions expressed by the authorities in the field of probation and delinquency and with a comparison of the opinions of authorities with those of probation workers in the field. In general, the authorities attached less value than did the probation officers to such incentives for entering the probation field as "love for humanity" and "service." They were also more conservative and more critical in evaluating traits. Greatest emphasis was placed by both groups on the possession of desirable personality traits and adequate training, including good character, the mastery of specific techniques, and the assumption of community responsibility. Education was considered more important by authorities and was minimized by officers, but the specific techniques of probation work were assigned similar values by both groups.

AB- An exploration into the wider implications of the term "conflict" and its social case work symbolizations allows the following conclusions: (1) "Non-cooperation" is relative, in that it refers to a degree of opposition. (2) Conflict cannot be considered to be due entirely or in large part to factors operating in the client's personality; it is an interaction involving both client and worker. (3) Conflict is associated in all the literature with the cultural and social manifestations of the individual. (4) It is necessary to probe deeply into the problems of adjustment and conflict in "un-cooperative" situations, so that conflict in social case work may be reduced to the minimum consistent with sound theory and practice.

AB- Although Freud, Adler, Jung, and Rank have been scientific in their purpose they have been metaphysical in their method, because they have tended to see personality as an entity without causal relationship to its conditioning environments. The time has now come to make a transition to a full scientific methodology in personality analysis and therapy. Behaviorism has attempted to understand the intricacies of personality and to work out a treatment technique based on this understanding. From the viewpoint of behaviorism, personality is the conditioned result of the infinite number of experiences that come with living in environments which become more complex as man makes them so. Both individual and environment are studied, because a realistic view of behavior makes this inevitable. Social workers should examine and understand this point of view, which offers a more comprehensive explanation of human motivation and its meaning than the mysticism of psychoanalysis.

This implies the development of an individual approach. The needs, interests, and capacities of each individual may be determined by case studies of situations outside the group work agency, by interviews, adjustment questionnaires, rating scales, and standardized tests. Specific knowledge of the contribution made to each participant may be gained through the use of objective and quantitative instruments of measurement.

AB- Relatives of clients who are able and willing to provide financial assistance usually do so without agency intervention. Their failure to aid the less fortunate members of their family may be ascribed to: "(1) the changing character of family life with weakened moral responsibility and feeble ties of attachment and solidarity; (2) unstable economic status of relatives; and (3) persistent feeling of rugged individualism which deeply permeates the American urban philosophy of life." Workers conducting such interviews should attempt to understand the causative factors underlying the relative's lack of interest. Pressure is unwarranted and useless. It is best to ascertain from the interviewees what is the best they can do for the client without too much sacrifice. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

In the 11 cases in which the mothers showed a great change, as well as in the four cases showing some change, all the children were successfully adjusted by the end of treatment. In the 15 cases in which the mothers' attitudes showed no change, six of the children were successfully adjusted and nine remained unimproved… . Most of the mothers whose attitudes showed no change during treatment were excessively dominating and aggressive. Many were extremely irritable, excitable, and unreasonable. They were generally self-centered and had a very narrow range of interest. The mothers whose attitudes became greatly changed during treatment were of a different personality type. For the most part, they were very insecure and felt inferior and were extremely conscientious." (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

Consultation service provided a definite means of assisting 23 of 32 families in problems other than those associated with their relief needs. Factors influencing the successful continuation of consultation service were the client's understanding of his own needs and the assistance offered by the agency, and also the ease with which the case worker saw the needs of the client.

AB- Except in one case, placement away from home was not intrinsically a traumatic experience. It tended, however, to precipitate or emphasize conflicts which already existed in the children's emotional lives. Four children who entered foster homes with attitudes of conflict toward their own parents carried over this conflict, in varying degrees, to their foster parents. The displacement of hostile attitudes from own to foster parents tended to prevent satisfactory relationships between child and foster parents and was often a cause of replacement. In general the children related themselves more intimately to foster mothers than to foster fathers. This is attributed to an emotional dependence upon the mother person.

A recommended technique for obtaining an evaluation of the work of such employees consists of the following: job analysis, determination of relative importance of each job factor, and how each factor can be best measured. Competency on the job may be measured by a merit rating scale and by objective psychological tests, the items of which may be made up from the job analysis. The technical information test for visitors developed in Pennsylvania by the authors had a reliability coefficient of .92 ± .001. The final step in merit ranking of employees consists of the composite evaluation with proper weighting for rating and test scores. The need for improvement in social service by the development of experimentally validated selection techniques is stressed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Of 10,000 employees of the Pennsylvania State Emergency Relief Administration, 4000 were relief visitors. The problem was to determine the minimum qualification of visitors with a view to improvement of selection techniques. A detailed inquiry was sent to 600 directors, regional supervisors, field representatives, junior supervisors, and others, of whom 588 responded. Among the results were: the most desirable age of visitors was 23-45 years; special training in the field of social work was preferred by 84% of the group who responded, and 28% would require college graduation; 88% felt that experience in social case work was beneficial; "need" of the prospective social worker should not be a factor in his or her selection; marital status, sex and nationality are relatively unimportant.

In over half of 32 cases studied at the Eastchester Neighborhood Association, Tuckahoe, N. Y., clients received treatment for problems having a specific emotional content, although none applied for help in emotional difficulties. In 10 cases the agency performed specific services, in 3 it helped with financial planning and management, in 4 no help was rendered, in 2 the agency assisted the clients to make environmental adjustments, and in 13 cases the agency treated emotional problems.

AB- An investigation of social and psychological adjustment of 45 dementia praecox patients, under 20 years of age when committed, five years after their commitment. The incidence of adverse home situations and personal maladjustment before the psychotic episode was high. 60% of the homes were rated as poor and 88% of the individuals as inadequately adjusted. The onset of the psychosis was gradual in 58% of the cases. Gradual onset seemed a particularly unfavorable sign, and an adverse early environment was almost equally indicative of a low chance of recovery. The kind of adjustment the patient had made before the psychosis was unimportant as a prognostic sign by itself, but was important when taken in conjunction with the other two traits. Combination of the unfavorable aspects of the three traits was very unfavorable for recovery within five years. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- "The chief objective of the investigation was to learn to what extent the children on a given street in a large city varied in social adjustment and to trace some of the factors that may have led to the differences among them. By selecting one small street with fairly uniform housing conditions certain of the grossest social and economic factors were held constant. By studying all the children some of the difficulties in attributing causal significance to certain factors were avoided… . The outstanding conclusion that emerges from this consideration of some of the factors that might account for the variation in social adjustment displayed by the children living on the same street is the pre-dominating influence of parental attitudes toward the children and the general relation between what are usually considered good parental attitudes and adequate social adjustment on the part of the children, but the various types of maladjustment in parental attitudes seemed to produce rather specific types of reaction in the children. Most of the families in which the children were shy, retiring, or generally socially inadequate had mothers that were, by one means or another, in complete control of the household. Some of them achieved dominance by psychosis or neurosis, others by native ability or by providing the family with economic support. For the most part they over-protected their children, either through excessive solicitude or by undue control of their activities. The fathers were either easy-going, quiet, submissive men or were no longer living at home." (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- "This investigation of the later behavior of a group of delinquents referred by the Juvenile Court for examination at the main office of the Illinois Institute for Juvenile Research had a double purpose: to compare the results of this court-clinic work with that reported by Sheldon and Eleanor Glueck for the Boston Juvenile Court and the Judge Baker Foundation, and to study in a more descriptive manner the children's adjustment and the causes for its variation. The first objective was greatly hampered by the fact that the present investigation was limited to one hundred and nineteen boys and girls compared with the Gluecks' one thousand boys. The second, also, was only partially achieved, due to the paucity of material… . In general, the investigation seemed to indicate that recidivism may not always be as frequent as the Glueck study suggests, that a more favorable showing for the work of court and clinic is made when less mechanical definitions of social adjustment are used, and that a close study of personality trends and environment situations might result in a clearer understanding of why some children do and others do not become recidivists."

"Free discussion" groups were held for clients of the agency. The author concludes that such discussions were of value "as a case-work measure, sometimes in supplementing the case workers' knowledge of their clients, sometimes in increasing the usefulness to the client of the case-work relationship. It increased the capacity of some of the mothers to participate in community life, and it led some to a clearer recognition of reality." (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- The effectiveness of clinical treatment in the later social adjustment of various types of problem children is reported in this series of papers. The evidence gathered in follow-up investigations of cases from thirteen clinics located in different areas of this country points out three main facts: (1) that behavior disorders do not affect later social adjustments except in cases where the children are psychotic; (2) that the results for various clinics are quite similar, even though their methods of treatment differ; (3) that the emotional set-up of the home is far more closely related to child adjustment than are such tangible factors as age, sex, nationality, and economic status.

AB- "This investigation attempted to arrive at an estimate of the value of a work-shop as an aid to child guidance treatment. The shop in question, a part of the Pittsburgh Child Guidance Center, is in charge of a manual arts instructor and is used by the staff as a means of observing, developing rapport with and treating boys who it is thought will benefit by such an experience. The first sixty boys who attended the shop formed the basis for the investigation, the data being secured from the case records in which had been noted such items as the reason for referring the boy to the shop, his initial reaction to it, length of attendance, articles made, quality of work, and so on." "The correlation between the extent to which the work-shop achieved its purposes in individual cases and the general results of clinic treatment was fairly high. Boys judged successfully treated in general were almost all rated as successes of the work-shop; for most of those judged partially improved by treatment the work-shop was considered successful; but among the failures in treatment there was a wide spread. This would seem to indicate that a work-shop is of value in a wide variety of cases and does not merely reflect changes that are being effected by other types of treatment. On the other hand, it also indicates that a work-shop cannot be a substitute for other forms of therapy, and that results achieved within the shop are not necessarily carried over in the outside world."

AB- "This paper describes the intake of the Illinois Institute for Juvenile Research with respect to feeble-minded children whose IQ's indicated their eligibility for commitment to state institutions. A six-months group of such children who were examined during 1932-33 was compared with a similarly selected group examined in 1928-29 with the purpose of determining the influence of the economic depression on that intake. No difference between the two periods in the proportion of feeble-minded children in the total clinic population was found, but there was an increase of about forty per cent in absolute numbers. The depression series was characterized by a larger proportion of young children and of children whose examination was requested by relief and child-caring agencies. A marked reduction in referrals by the court was also noted." These and other considerations lead to the conclusion that the chief influence of the depression on the intake of feebleminded has been a greater use of Institute resources on behalf of the not-so-difficult cases.

AB- This study is an investigation of six generations of a family living in an eastern state. Data were obtained from living members of the family, other informants, social agencies, hospitals, town records, and state institutions. "The line of inheritance of mental disease in this family appears to have been strikingly direct. But rather than being on the increase, it seems to be on the decline, the chances of an individual's becoming psychotic being less with each successive generation. Both of these facts must be kept in mind in drawing generalizations from this family, for both are important. The first lends weight to the theory of direct transmission of mental disease, particularly manic-depressive psychosis, but it gives no indication as to whether the causative factors are biological or environmental. The other emphasizes the fact that even psychotic individuals have many more normal than psychotic descendants, and that the tendency is away from rather than toward progressive deterioration."

AB- This follow-up study of 25 truants five years after they had been patients of the Esek Hopkins and Juvenile Court Clinics of Rhode Island leads to the following conclusions: "that truancy does not necessarily lead to delinquency in the majority of cases; that a diagnostic clinic service can be of real value in helping truants to a more acceptable social adjustment if its recommendations are carried out by the referring agencies; that such a type of treatment is likely to fail in cases in which the child's difficulty is traceable to parental attitudes of over-indulgence, or, particularly, rejection; that, in non-neurotic cases, much can be accomplished by following along with the children's native interests; and that, in all cases, there is much in the accidental happenings beyond clinic control that may make or mar a child's adjustment."

In addition to the material obtained from the case records, follow-up visits were made in seventeen cases. All the children who could be located were retested by the writer on both the Stanford-Binet and the Diagnostic Reading tests." "A comparison of the changes in reading ability with the changes in behavior indicated that improvement in one field bore little relation to improvement in the other. Some children improved in both reading and behavior. Others improved in reading but showed no change in behavior, and vice versa. A few did not improve in either field. Modification of behavior symptoms seemed to occur only when the tutoring was supplemented by some form of social-psychiatric treatment, or when the parent-child relationship was obviously satisfactory. The few cases in which such treatment failed were characterized by unusually severe emotional handicaps." (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- This study is an analysis of twenty-six boys referred from the Hartley-Salmon Clinic of Hartford to the Connecticut Junior Republic. The case records of the clinic are analyzed for age, national background, intelligence quotient, and source of referral, and the cases are classified and compared according to personality, emotional tone of the home, parental attitudes, and neighborhood. Adjustment at the Republic and after leaving the Republic is reported. The author concludes that "this specialized form of institutional treatment seems to offer something of value to one definite type of boy (the average adolescent who is of normal intelligence, makes friends, but comes from a poor environment) and, also, to a few other individual boys if they have certain special abilities or capacities which find outlet in the Republic program. The general trend of the boys' adjustments during and after treatment would seem to indicate that what they gain during their experience at the Republic usually carries over after their return to the community."

Pretreatment observation and analysis of records are valuable diagnostic and prognostic aids. The controlled setting should facilitate the distinction between "individual maladjustments in a normal family and normal individuals in a maladjusted family."

AB- An academic achievement chart was found to be a good predictor of emotional instability among early grade school children. A much larger percent of pupils referred for social work attention because of emotional problems, than of pupils not so referred, scored low on this chart. Many more of the disturbed children, who obtained low scores on this achievement chart, than the undisturbed who scored as poorly, improved in academic showing in later years.

SU- Emotional Disturbances
AB- The early history of autistic children frequently contains evidence of severe feeding problems, massive startle reactions to mild stimuli, extreme passivity and other deviant characteristics which thwart the mother's psychobiological need to nurture successfully, rouse in her hostility and guilt, and interfere with the establishment of healthy mothering patterns. Her nonadaptive responses in turn reinforce the child's deviance. The concept of mutually deleterious mother-child transactions deliberately bypasses the theoretical controversy of organic or psychogenic etiology but supplies a basis for treatment of the mother. "The goal of casework [is] achieving an optimal interrelationship between the mother's personality structure and the child's special needs." Specific techniques are discussed.

AB- An "investigation, carried out by seven students of Smith College School for Social Work in five state hospitals,… to test the theory that functional psychoses occur chiefly in individuals whose personality is different from that considered normal and who grew up under unusually irritating or handicapping emotional conditions." Four informants per case were seen for 40 manic-depressive and 68 dementia praecox patients. "Many of the patients, especially the schizophrenics, were described as always having had a personality pattern that differed from the normal. And in a large proportion of the homes handicapping emotional conditions of one type or another were reported. The home conditions seemed somewhat worse on the average in the manic-depressive group, while among the schizophrenics individuals of poor social adjustment were more frequent." "Over-protection, often of an extreme form, was fairly common, especially in the manic-depressive group, and in a third of the cases the mother was unusually dominant and the father played a very weak role."

The monozygotic pair III differed markedly in physical appearance and in intelligence. The dizygotic pair IV was much alike in physical and intellectual measurements. Only Twins II were strikingly alike in personality. It would seem best, then—as others have pointed out—to discard the term that implies duplicate or identical characteristics."

Work, suggested that in the behavior of the parents toward the children who were clinic patients was to be found an index to the probable outcome of treatment. This paper reports the results of testing the reliability of the parental behavior categories; and the findings in an additional hundred and two cases of success and failure." Results are in agreement with those of the original investigation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- An analysis of 72 cases carried by the Family Society of Philadelphia in cooperation with public relief agencies. A large number of the families were white, native-born Americans, with the great majority belonging to the laboring group. The chief factor in determining the level of treatment, described as "relief," "opportunity," "adjustment," or "therapy" was the client's desire for that kind of service. From the large number of cases carried on a relief level and the small number carried on an adjustment or therapy level, the author suggests the general conclusion that only a small number of clients receiving unemployment relief desire case-work help.

AB- A study of 22 cases of stuttering treated at the Institute for Child Guidance, New York. "The chief difference between the various adjustment groups appeared to lie in the relative seriousness of the problems which they presented. The unadjusted were handicapped by both physical and emotional traits and by the attitude of their parents. In the partially adjusted group, handicapping parental attitudes were offset by the patients' more favorable personalities. That the successfully adjusted were even more favorably situated from an emotional point of view is suggested by the fact that they improved under social manipulative treatment. Since these findings are in agreement with those of other studies of child guidance results, the conclusion seems indicated that stuttering may accompany various degrees of personality disorder and that prognosis is dependent on these other attendant conditions."

AB- Three groups are compared: a group of 50 hyperactive children, a control group of 50 non-hyperactive problem children of the same age, and a second control group of 100 non-hyperactive problem children unselected with respect to age. It was found that the groups were practically identical in mean intelligence and frequency distribution of the intelligence quotients. Hyperactivity was slightly more common among boys than among girls; the difference was not statistically significant. The hyperactive children were not underweight, but tended to be of two general types—dull overweight and bright underweight. The only significant difference found in the comparison of the three groups was the difference in age between the first and third groups. The hyperactive children were definitely younger than the run of clinic patients. Data in physical findings and developmental histories were too incomplete to justify definite conclusions.

AB- Data were obtained from the case records of the Illinois Institute for Juvenile Research and home interviews, in which a questionnaire was filled in by the interviewer. 52 children with reading disability and 53 children with normal reading ability were compared. The ranges in intelligence quotients in the groups were comparable. Age, sex, and the number of children in the family were not constant. The writer found that "there was no relation between speech defects and left-handedness in a family history and reading disability in a patient, but there was a slight tendency for reading difficulties to be more frequent in the families of reading-disability patients than in those of other children."

Degree of cooperation, attitude toward the examiner, and speed in the test showed no relationship to variability in IQ, while degree of reflectiveness and attention were slightly more favorable in the group whose IQ advanced. Improvement in physical condition, parental attitudes, and symptomatic behavior also is definitely associated with variability in IQ. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- During the winter of 1931-1932 the Philadelphia Family Society and the Bureau of Unemployment coöperated in caring for clients who showed a need for some service in addition to relief. This experiment gave some indication of the value of coöperation between a case-work agency and a public agency and showed some of the difficulties which would arise in referring cases needing and willing to accept case work. It was found that there was almost complete agreement between the two agencies on those problems which had overt manifestations, but that the Family Society worker found in addition many problems involving emotional difficulties.

AB- 362 delinquent girls were matched for age and nationality or race with the same number of school girls who lived in approximately the same parts of Chicago as did the delinquents. When the broken home was defined as one from which one or both natural parents were absent, it was found that 67% of the delinquents and 45% of the non-delinquents came from such homes. When the broken home was defined as one containing only one parent, the difference between delinquents and non-delinquents was not so great. The mothers of 38% of the delinquent girls, as compared with 29% for the non-delinquents, worked for wages. When broken homes were held constant, however, these differences largely disappeared. Thus it seemed that the broken home was more directly related to delinquency than was the fact that the mother worked. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Twenty-two foster homes, chosen from those in use by the New England Home for Little Wanderers in October, 1929, were studied to determine the characteristics of a good foster home. The homes had been used by the agency for at least two years, and at least two children had been placed in each. A statistical comparison of these homes showed that (1) nearly all of the foster parents were middle-aged, (2) most of them had children of their own who were approaching adulthood, (3) in social position they were lower middle class, (4) they boarded children partly because they needed money, and (5) the women were largely aggressive and self-reliant. The difference between successful and unsuccessful foster mothers, however, lay in the degree of security they offered to the children. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- The authors studied the records of ten patients of the Cook County (Illinois) Psychopathic Hospital who had been examined at the Institute for Juvenile Research at least two years before their commitment, to discover whether future psychoses can be foreseen, and, if so, in what types of patients. In three of the ten cases the psychiatrist did not predict any later serious mental difficulty, in another four cases the psychiatrist recognized a marked personality difficulty and described the patient as either psychoneurotic or a psychopathic personality, while in the remaining three cases the psychiatrist either recognized or predicted an impending mental disease. In no case did a marked change in personality occur, but in successive examinations a definite accentuation of early traits was noted. These patients had two traits in common: each was described as solitary or seclusive, and eight of the ten possessed violent tempers. The ten cases are presented in detail.

KP- SOCIAL FUNCTIONS OF THE INDIVIDUAL
AB- The author endeavored to discover the possibilities of a single interview and to find out whether short-contact experience could be given to students in some form. The study was carried out at the New York Children's Aid Society, interviewing those who desired either to place a child or to offer their homes for foster children. The writer concludes that short-contact interviewing is of the same essential quality as intensive case work. The first objective should be the securing of as great a degree of participation and responsibility on the part of the client as he is capable of at the time. This was found to prepare for a cooperative casework relationship subsequently. The writer feels that students can be trained for short-contact interviewing if they develop a personal security. The body of the article is composed of numerous detailed histories illustrating different types of applicants. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

There is almost perfect correlation between the degree of cardiac difficulty and the presence of mental-hygiene problems. The majority of cardiac patients, furthermore, do not complain of subjective symptoms. Those who do complain usually have emotional problems.

KP- NAIL BITING
KP- CHILD
KP- CHILDHOOD AND ADOLESCENCE
AB- Numerous factors in the lives of a group of children who bit their nails are analyzed statistically in an attempt to evaluate some popular notions. A control group was employed. The results indicate that nail biting occurs more frequently in girls in the age groups of six to eight years and fifteen years and over. In boys the habit predominates in ages nine through eleven years. It shows no relationship to either intelligence or physical condition, nor is it associated significantly with any one pattern of problem behavior. No evidence was obtained for the popular association of nail-biting and masturbation or nervousness or introvertive tendencies. The chief difference between the two groups lies in the frequency of situations which created tension in the home. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- "The records of forty-five over-protective and forty-five non-over-protective mothers were compared for fourteen factors which were thought to make for marital discord, and there was found to be a consistently greater positive incidence of these factors in the over-protective than in the non-protective group." Some of these factors were social maladjustment, sexual maladjustment, disagreement over discipline, disagreement over the desire for children, interfering relatives, and economic dissatisfaction.

AB- Levy's hypothesis concerning the etiology of maternal over-protection is tested by comparing two groups of mothers, one definitely over-protective and the other non-protective, in regard to the frequency with which they exhibit certain traits important in the etiology. The over-protective mothers exceed the control group in such traits as unhappy childhood, early development of a responsible rôle, and extra hazard presented by the children.

AB- This paper continues a study begun by Olin and combines more recent findings with those upon which she reported. An attempt was made to check on the presence or absence of problems noted at the time of the original study and on the home deviations that seemed to be factors in producing those problems. Adjustment was rated according to a scale that ran from A to E. The factors most highly associated with adjustment were those which reflected the children's emotional environment.

AB- One hundred patients at the Institute for Child Guidance who had been breast-fed for twelve months or longer were compared with one hundred that had been nursed for one month or less. The factor of chief importance in determining the length of the nursing period appeared to be the mother's attitude toward the child. Women who rejected their children constituted half of the one-month-or-less group, while two-thirds of the women who nursed their children for twelve months or more were described as over-protective.

AB- In a study of the relationship between the childhood experiences of mothers and the attitudes they later displayed toward their children, over-protection appears to be associated with a lack of affection and responsibility. Affection and responsibility frequently characterize the childhood of mothers who display a neutral attitude toward their children, while affection and a lack of responsibility are associated with the attitude of rejection.

AB- Thirty over-protected children were compared with two hundred non-over-protected children. The differences in age at learning to walk, to talk, and to establish bladder control were not large enough to be considered of statistical significance, but they did lean in the direction of earlier learning on the part of the over-protected. 41% of the over-protected children, however, as compared with 7% of the non-over-protected, were breast-fed for twelve months or longer. It appeared that the attitude of over-protection was more effective in altering the mothers' behavior than in influencing the children's development.

Their attitudes toward relief do not reveal either their actual or potential dependency, but indicate their emotional adjustment. The author believes that for the effective use of relief the social worker must be aware of the possible meanings of relief and of the possible interpretations of the attitudes shown by the client toward the relief.

In general 75% of the Ss showed "some" to "excellent" improvement according to the ward physicians. Evaluation of the camp's effectiveness by the 6 permanent staff members on a 5-point scale yielded the following results: 22% unchanged or worse, 35% some or fair improvement, 25% good and 17% excellent improvement. 39 patients were rated and 18 campers (30%) were judged sufficiently recovered for discharge.

SU- Clients; Group Counseling; Group Psychotherapy
AB- Family Service of Milwaukee undertook group counseling on an experimental basis to test the hypothesis that some clients would respond more readily to group counseling than to individual counseling. Since the hypothesis is supported by the evidence from this project, the agency hopes to expand its casework service to include group counseling and to learn more about the effectiveness and limitations of this technique. Because the maximum number of group meetings was limited to 30, the treatment goals for each member were modest. 3 of the women (Mrs. O, Mrs. M, and Mrs. L) expressed their satisfaction with the group and, by mutual agreement with the caseworker, terminated their contact with the agency. After 2 months, Mrs. S returned to the agency for individual counseling. Mrs. B moved away, but applied for treatment at a mental health clinic in her new location. In much of the professional literature, group counseling is proposed as an economy that enables one caseworker to treat more clients than he could treat in individual counseling. The results of this project do not support this assumption. On the contrary, for each group meeting, a minimum of 5 hours was spent in recording and planning, in formulating diagnoses, and in participating in psychiatric consultations. For some clients group counseling appears to be more effective than individual counseling in 2 specific areas: (a) securing diagnostic data and (b) penetrating the defenses of projection and denial. Group counseling is the treatment of choice when the client is tightly defended and is threatened in the 1-to-1 relationship. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Ego psychology can best be understood if viewed in historical perspective. In the early period of the development of psychoanalytic theory, a major interest was focused on libidinal drives and their intrapsychic vicissitudes. Beginning with Freud, leading theorists have believed that the psychoanalytic theoretical framework could become a general theory of human psychology. Recent developments in ego psychology contain many rich insights into the processes of adaptation. The major contributions of Hartmann and his collaborators and of Erikson have been described. The ego is now viewed as the central meeting ground of drives and their derivatives, the individual's sense of self and identity, and his sense of his relationship with the human and nonhuman environment around him. The study of ego psychology is necessary and useful for any person engaged in the arduous and complicated task—a task nonetheless infinitely rewarding—of working with people in their environments.

AB- Modified group psychotherapy referred to as "demands of daily living" (as used at the Rehabilitation Centre for the Blind in Florida) is described. Daily sessions for an 8-week period are devoted to the fairly superficial surface problems of clients which may hinder their satisfactory social and economic adjustment. Traumatic emotional problems are handled individually. These group sessions are augmented by special staff-and-client group discussions of more general nature. Topics include: social life, courtship, marriage, and heredity and family. A Three Answer Test, now in the experimental stage, designed to yield a frank analysis of the blind person's self-concept and ego development is briefly described.

The delinquent's self portrayal was more highly negativistic of self and of future goals, and less marked by group identification than was that of the nondelinquent.

AB- After studying the outcome of cases referred to an agency, it is concluded that "while hope is necessary in seeking help, it does not guaranty the use of it. Conversely, while discomfort did not apepar sufficient to enable families to seek help, high discomfort appeared to have greater value as a predictor of follow-through." Follow-through was more strongly associated with continued discomfort than with having positive feelings towards the clinic. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

KP- JEALOUSY

KP- CHILDHOOD AND ADOLESCENCE
AB- A statistical study based on data obtained from the case record index cards of the Institute for Child Guidance in New York and of the clinics held for demonstration purposes by the Commonwealth Fund. The classifications were accepted at face value and no attempt was made to study the original case records. The data are analyzed so as to show comparisons: (1) descriptive of the patient, i.e., sex, age, IQ, number of children and ordinal position; (2) symptomatic behavior of the patient, such as negativism, fears, sensitiveness, inferiority, fatigability, speech defects, and running away from home; and (3) parental attitudes, mother protection, unfavorable comparison and mother nagging. These data are given in eight tables. Jealousy seems to occur in a slightly larger proportion among girls than among boys, and tends to appear in the earlier ages of childhood. It is somewhat more frequent among bright than among dull children. A larger proportion of jealous than of non-jealous children were first born, particularly in two-child families.

AB- A representative nursery school includes in its program a healthy environment, training in health habits, health examinations, instructions to parents in child hygiene, and research projects in various phases of child health. "Outdoors whenever possible" is a maxim. Each school believes it can offer opportunities for development which the best homes cannot duplicate. Too rapid popularization of nursery schools is discouraged by those interested in the movement because of the expense of proper maintenance, the lack of enough trained teachers, and the danger resulting from inadequate facilities for safeguarding the health of the children.

AB- Home work after being driven out of the needle trades is reappearing in the newer trades such as making lamp shades and artificial flowers. Manufacturers located their plants in the negro districts to tap the supply of labor. Then they began to farm out their work to negro women, some of whom established what amounted to branch factories in their homes. Usually they take up this work to maintain a decent standard of living, which the earnings of their husbands are unable to provide. The pay is fair, although under constant downward pressure; the working conditions are generally good; it is not accompanied by any serious child labor in the homes.

AB- Figures obtained from the records of the Judge Baker Foundation show that alcoholism of the parents is associated with juvenile delinquency, although the absence of similar information about nondelinquent children makes it impossible to arrive at definite conclusions concerning the relative importance of this factor. Alcoholism is found to be associated with the disruption of the family home and with the desertion and non-support of the family by the father. Failure to support the family and alcoholism on the part of the father are closely related to the employment of the mother, which, in turn, usually results in less adequate care and guidance of the children. Even in 1925 alcoholism presented a considerable problem among parents of delinquent children in Boston, but during recent years alcoholism among the fathers has been considerably less than in the years before 1919.

The contract defines treatment goals for the worker and client and sets a time limit on their accomplishment.

The 42 items which discriminated were administered to another 40 delinquents and 40 controls. The difference between the means of scores for the 2 groups was significant at the .001 level. A 2nd administration of this test to 20 of the 40 delinquents 8 weeks later and ratings on this group by superintendents reveal significant test-retest stability and suggestive rating-test score relationship.

AB- Of 64 brief papers, the following are of interest to psychologists. L. J. Saul, psychoanalyst, illustrates the need of psychosomatic knowledge in case work by presenting cases of stomach pains, ulcers, asthma, high blood pressure, etc. G. May makes suggestions, based on British experience, for case work in the defense program, which field he holds to be very poorly understood by Americans. J. S. Plant, G. Coyle, H. Lippman, E. Harral, W. Overholser offer psychiatric interpretations, respectively, of problems of older children in general, older children in group work, adolescents, foster parents, the elderly.
