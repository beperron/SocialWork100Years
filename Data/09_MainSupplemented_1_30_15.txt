AB- This study sought to determine whether the presence of HIV testing inside a gay bathhouse reduced sexual risk behavior among patrons. A two-stage, time probability, cluster sample design recruited men exiting a northern California bathhouse in the last 5 weeks of 2001 (N = 440), when no HIV testing was offered inside the bathhouse, and again in the last 5 weeks of 2002 (N = 412), when HIV testing was offered 5 days a week. Separate logistic regression analyses compared a 2002 HIV testing exposure subgroup with both a 2001 nonexposure subgroup and a 2002 nonexposure subgroup for differences in sexual risk behavior during the bathhouse visit. Prevalence of unprotected insertive anal intercourse was significantly lower in the 2002 exposure subgroup than in the 2002 nonexposure subgroup. Similar results obtained when HIV-positive respondents were excluded. These results indicate onsite HIV testing has a preventive effect on some sexual risk behavior inside the bathhouse.

AB- This study evaluates a newly designed HIV/AIDS program that combined Voluntary Counseling and Testing (VCT) services with online prevention education videos featuring South African celebrities. Learners from five public secondary schools in Cape Town participated in the pilot study (N = 3,271). Results indicated participant reactions to the video were overwhelmingly positive, and there were both significant increases in HIV knowledge and significant decreases in fear of being tested. Eighty-eight percent of learners received HIV tests and indicated much higher rates of VCT uptake than comparable programs implemented in South Africa. Future research possibilities are discussed, as well as recommendations for programs delivering similar services among diverse populations.

AB- Malawian adolescents are at risk for HIV infection. Using a quasi-experimental two-group research design, we determined the efficacy of Mzake ndi Mzake Kuunikira Achinyamata (MMKA) in enhancing 13- to 19-year-old Malawian males’ and females’ HIV knowledge, attitude about HIV, self-efficacy for condom use and for safer sex, and HIV risk reduction behaviors. The regression analyses revealed that compared with their cohorts in the control community, the adolescents in the MMKA community had significantly better scores on the outcome variables. The intervention had significant benefits for male and 16- to 19-year-old adolescents but not for 13- to 15-year-old female adolescents. Tailored interventions are needed for these females.

AB- Young black men who have sex with men (MSM) are disproportionately impacted by HIV. The authors assessed the characteristics of recent sexual partnerships among 180 young black MSM, ages 15 to 24; 153 (85%) reported anal or vaginal sex in the prior 90 days with 363 sexual partners. Men's partners were typically older (age-discordant) than the respondent and of the same race (race-concordant) as the respondent. Men in age-discordant partnerships displayed a pattern of higher risk behavior including more partners and fewer regular partners than did men in age-concordant partnerships. Race-discordant partnerships were riskier than race-concordant partnerships. Prevention implications for adolescent and young men are discussed.

AB- African American women continue to be disproportionately burdened by HIV and AIDS. An important determinant of the risk of transmission lies in the characteristics of sexual partnerships. The current study explores the sexual risk behaviors of a vulnerable population subgroup of African American women who engage in sexual partnerships with men who are sex traders and have sex with both men and women. The sample was 106 adult African American women. Data regarding sociodemographics, drug-using behavior, sexual practices, HIV and sexually transmitted infections, and health-seeking behaviors were analyzed. Nearly 90% of participants reported unprotected vaginal sex and using crack cocaine in the previous 3 months. The recent use of heroin was significantly associated with diminished condom use. A clear majority of the participants did not know their HIV status. This study is the first to examine and document shared structural and behavioral risk profiles of this population.

AB- Knowledge of HIV status provides opportunities for patients to seek early treatment, facilitates referral for social support, counseling on contraceptive use and responsible sexual behavior. The authors identify factors that predispose young people (15 to 24 years) to seek HIV testing. Drawing on data from the 2008 Ghana Demographic and Health Survey, both bivariate and multivariate results are presented. Compared with females, males reported minimal levels of testing, although demand for testing was observed to be generally low among the respondents. For females, being married or cohabiting correlated with testing decisions, while age was the key determinant among males. High frequency of exposure to a radio was a common determinant between both sexes. Because testing will continue to be a major strategy for HIV prevention, it is imperative to make messages on testing attractive to increase uptake among young people who are at higher risk of infection.

AB- The articles in this issue point to some of the complexities in staging effective interventions to prevent or attenuate HIV risk. The cultural context and cultural meaning of such factors as intimacy and trust, marital and non marital relationships, testing settings and responsiveness of the population at risk are all important factors. For social service providers, care and support often take dominance over the means available to help those at risk reduce that risk and prolong life. Integrating prevention opportunities into our array of HIV services and linkages to care is an important tool to work toward our goal of finding an end for HIV= AIDS, within both the cultural context and the array of structural arrangements that pose challenges to providers and people at risk for HIV alike.

AB- The authors' aims were to assess the associations of sexual risk behavior with psychiatric impairment and individual, peer, and partner attitudes among adolescents receiving mental health treatment. Adolescents (N = 893, 56% female, 67% African American) completed assessments of psychiatric impairment, rejection sensitivity, peer norms, HIV knowledge, perceived vulnerability, self-efficacy, and condom use intentions. Two structural equation models were used to test the study hypotheses: one for sexually active youth and one for nonactive youth. For nonactive youth, psychiatric impairment influenced self-efficacy and condom use intentions via peer norms, rejection sensitivity, and perceived vulnerability. Among the sexually active youth, sexual risk was related to impairment and previous condom use. These results suggest that individual, peer, and partner factors are related to impairment and to sexual risk attitudes but depend on previous sexual experience.

AB- Adolescents in foster care experience mental health and substance use problems that place them at risk for HIV, yet the exact nature of the relationship remains unclear. This study examined the co-occurring influences of mental health problems and substance use on HIV risk and determined whether substance use moderated the effect of mental health problems on HIV risk behaviors among adolescents in foster care. Regression analyses of cross-sectional data collected through structured interviews with 334 adolescents, aged 15 to 18 years, determined which mental health problems and substances increased HIV risk behaviors. Adolescents with delinquency and anxiety/depression engaged in significantly more HIV risk behaviors than their counterparts, controlling for race, gender, and type of childhood abuse. Further, any marijuana use significantly moderated the effects of delinquent behaviors on HIV risk, differentially increasing HIV risk among those who engaged in delinquent behaviors.

AB- Digital games have shown promise in studies focusing on disease prevention and disease self-management in children and young adolescents. The purpose of this study was to gather formative data for the design of an HIV prevention game for adolescents. Qualitative research methods that included focus group sessions with four groups of adolescents were used (N = 38). Content analysis strategies were used to analyze verbatim transcripts and observational notes. Themes emerging from the data included: players’ control, virtual reward systems, immersive action, and the need for tailoring. Findings are being used in the design of a digital game that is responsive to recommendations to “make it like the real world.” HIV prevention strategies could benefit from incorporating emerging technologies that are inherently attractive to many adolescents. Adolescent participants support the use of digital games in HIV prevention and wanted such games to reflect their lives.

AB- This study examined the prevalence and correlates of drug use among emerging adult members of the Los Angeles house and ball community. The associations of lifetime and 90-day illicit drug use with sociodemographic and house and ball community factors were assessed using bivariate analyses and logistic regression. Study participants had high rates of illicit substance use when compared to similar populations. Age was related to lifetime illicit substance use (t = 4.66, p &lt; .05). School enrollment was significantly protective against illicit drug use, even after controlling for age, race, and gender (odds ratio = .88, p &lt; .05, 95% confidence interval 0.18 to 0.98). School enrollment may be an important opportunity for prevention efforts related to illicit substance use and subsequent accumulating HIV risk within this community.

AB- The aim of this project was to examine factors associated with substance use treatment participation among individuals using illicit drugs who were also receiving other health and social services. Data were collected from 1,189 respondents sampled in the Countywide Risk Assessment Survey in Los Angeles County, California. A binary logistic regression was used to examine behavioral model indicators and HIV risk behaviors associated with treatment use. Differences were found with regard to predisposing and need variables and to HIV risk behaviors between those who accessed treatment and those who did not. There are implications for targeted prevention strategies and triangulated service integration. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Reviews the book, Social Work with HIV & AIDS: A Case-Based Guide by D. Rowan (see record [rid]2012-15755-000[/rid]). It is noted that this book is written from the perspective of social workers. The reviewer contends that the contents of each chapter are clearly delineated, developed, and understood by both the novice and experienced social work practitioner who draw upon competent experiences and knowledge and who demonstrate competence in multiple social work practice areas. Through these contributors, Rowan has captured broad and minute practice-related concerns, challenges, and strengths of diverse cultural groups including women, men, African Americans, Latinos, adolescents, young adults, and the aged populations as these groups seek and adhere to expert and empowering care. Beyond the comprehensiveness of care at the micro and mezzo levels, historical and current complex policies are articulated with a clear focus on policies that impact local, national, and international interventions. Considering that social workers are taught to embrace the wholeness of the client system, treatment responses are discussed from a paradigm that considers the biopsychosocial spiritual humanity of the HIV/AIDS-infected/ affected person. The uniqueness of Rowan's text is its use of case examples and planning that present with each chapter. These cases provide opportunities for reflection, critical thinking, problem solving, assessment, treatment, and the analysis of work performed.

AB- The author explores the perceptions of the intersection of HIV and domestic violence from a cultural context among a sample of professional African American women, and how social workers can better respond to the intersection. While African American women compose 13% of the U.S. female population, they represent 64% of U.S. HIV cases among women. The aim of this study was to generate an understanding of how HIV and domestic violence intersect for African American women. Four focus groups were conducted with three cohorts of 22 African American/Caribbean American women for 12 focus groups. There were five major themes generated from the study: being from a low-income community is not always the major factor, relationships are complex and viewed as essential, HIV is serious but perceived risk is low, fear is a driving force of decision-making regarding relationships, and the strength of communalism is perceived as having diminished in the African American community. Implications for social work practice include creating greater awareness of the intersections between HIV, domestic violence and cultural context among African American women and to enhance the social work response to these intersections in practice, policy, and research.

AB- To understand the beneficial aspects of a psychoeducational group, parents living with HIV participated in two telephone interviews. Twelve parents answered open-ended questions about program processes, components, and activities. Study participants identified five processes: focused and motivated; learn from each other; share freely with people who understand; support and care about each other; respect each other’s privacy; and protect each other. The identified knowledge areas—self-care, parenting, and goal-setting— were consistent with the program’s focus. Components noted were those activities designed to develop comfort between participants, share ideas, and practice skills. Goal-setting and monitoring progress represented a primary task that brought focus to the group’s endeavors and around which knowledge was shared and feedback and support were provided, strengthening the bonds between the participants. As people with HIV are living longer, programming can take a future orientation, supporting parents in raising children and leading productive lives.

AB- The authors investigated how parents living with HIV/AIDS communicate about HIV prevention with their 10- to 18-year-old children. Semistructured interviews with 76 mothers and fathers were analyzed for (a) their experiences discussing HIV prevention with adolescents and (b) advice for other parents about how to best broach HIV-related topics. Interactive conversations were regarded as particularly effective. A five-step process for interactive communication emerged as a result of these discussions. Parents emphasized that adolescents should have a “voice” and a “choice” in HIV-related talks. Health care professionals can facilitate adolescent sexual health by encouraging parents to actively involve their children in discussions about HIV prevention. Future HIV prevention programs could benefit by providing parents with appropriate tools to foster interactive discussions about sexual health with adolescents.

AB- The purpose of this study was to assess (a) perceptions of the physician-patient relationship among youth with HIV and (b) the relationship between the perceived physician-patient relationship and disease management variables. Participants were 72 youth with HIV ages 13–24. The Patient Reactions Assessment (PRA) and the Adolescent Patient-Provider Interaction Scale (APPIS) were administered. Results suggest positive perceptions among youth with HIV about their relationship with their physicians. There was a significant correlation between PRA and APPIS scores. However, there were no significant correlations between scores on the PRA and APPIS and demographic or disease management variables.

AB- The number of adolescents living with HIV is increasing globally. Within the United States, there are over 40,000 youth, 13–24 years old, living with HIV infection. Adherence to antiretroviral medication among this population is critical to promote health and decrease the risk of secondary HIV transmission. However, only approximately one-third of adolescents adhere to their HIV medications. Social workers are in a unique position to help support adolescents and their families with medication adherence. The authors describe a case study of the introduction of social work services to a cohort of high-risk youth who previously did not have access to a pediatric social worker. Three case examples are included to illustrate the wide array of family needs and strengths as well as social work interventions used to promote medication adherence as measured by immune functioning and viral load. Significant improvements in CD4 counts and viral loads were found following the implementation of social work services. Findings indicated that individualized social work interventions can improve medication adherence and the subsequent health of adolescents living with HIV.

AB- Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has changed HIV-related illness from terminal to chronic by suppressing viral load which results in immunologic and clinical improvement. Success with ART is dependent on optimal adherence, commonly categorized as &gt;95%. As medication type, class and frequency of use continue to evolve, we assessed adherence levels related to viral suppression. Using a cross-sectional analysis with secondary data (n = 381) from an ongoing multi-site study on impact of ART on the Central Nervous System (CNS), we compared self-reported adherence rates with biological outcomes of HIV-RNA copies/ml, and CD4 cell/mm³. Adherence to ART measures included taking all prescribed medication as directed on schedule and following dietary restrictions. While depression was a barrier to adherence, undetectable viral suppression was achieved at pill adherence percentages lower than 95%. Practice, research and policy implications are discussed in the context of patient-, provider-, and system-level factors influencing adherence to ART.

AB- [Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 13(2) of Journal of HIV/AIDS & Social Services (see record [rid]2014-22363-007[/rid]). In Volume 13, Issue 1 of Journal of HIV=AIDS & Social Services, the incorrect middle initial was listed for Danielle R. Rosen, co-author of the Commentary, ‘‘Mass Incarceration: The HIV =AIDS Epidemic and the Affordable Care Act— What Will the Future Hold?,’’ pp. 5–7. The correct name is presented in the erratum. The publisher would like to apologize for this error.] This article maintains that fifty years from today, historians are likely to look back on this era and describe it as a time of great promise, great possibilities, and great challenges. It is argued that nowhere are the conditions of promise, possibilities, and challenges more evident than in an analysis of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and its (potential) impact on the HIV/AIDS epidemic. As the epidemic rages into its third decade, it is increasingly thriving on and at home in the pockets of disadvantage and inequality that dot the American landscape. Additionally, it increasingly impacts those who are also at risk for being homeless and who are likely engaged with ongoing interactions with the criminal justice system. Disaster scenarios and worst case scenarios have been part of the HIV/AIDS epidemic since it was first recognized in 1981. Future historians will be fascinated and intrigued by the efforts to mainstream care for those caught up in this epidemic. Those who work in HIV see the imperative to ensure that this happens with, perhaps, greater clarity than anyone else. But that ending requires action now, and becoming engaged in the political and logistical struggles of ACA is now a top item on the future agenda of those of us for whom HIV remains very much a part of our challenges for the present.

AB- In the third decade of HIV=AIDS, substance use continues to be a risk factor for HIV infection, particularly for youth found in the intersections of mental health programs and court adjudicated services. Youth who are in hard-to-reach or hard-to-access subcultures (e.g., house and ball communities) are as hard to access by generic universal test-and-treat programs as are youth who do not fit a particular at-risk category. Thus, preventive approaches remain important strategies for hard-to-access and hard-to-reach populations in all communities. The articles in this issue provide accounts of programs that provide the third plank of HIV reduction in the United States. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- To serve the unique needs of HIV-positive adolescents, an adolescent- focused HIV program, which included clinical, psychosocial, and community-based services, was established in rural Rwanda. From October 1, 2009, to February 1, 2011, 206 HIV-positive adolescents aged 11 to 19 years were enrolled, of whom 10 transferred care out of the program. Overall, 191 (97.5%) of 196 adolescents were retained, 4 (2%) were lost to follow-up, and 1 (0.5%) died. Median follow-up time was 4.6 (interquartile range 3.2 to 5.7) years. Among 124 patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART) for at least 1 year, median CD4 increase was 347 cells/mm³ (36 to 553), and 87% achieved virologic suppression (&lt; 500 copies/mL). Clinic attendance was high, with 90.8% and 88.5% of ART-initiated and pre-ART patients, respectively, attending the clinic within 90 days of the end of the follow-up period. Our findings suggest that integrated, comprehensive, and youth-friendly clinics for HIV-positive adolescents can be successful in rural, resource-poor settings.

AB- The fragmentation of HIV-related diagnostic and treatment services, especially for youth, is a significant barrier for engaging in care. The authors identified key elements that affected care linkage efforts and conducted 64 interviews across 15 clinical sites. The constant comparative method was used. Primary linkages to care processes are illustrated through three geographically diverse case studies. Factors included interagency relationships, data-sharing protocols, and service duplication concerns. Program improvement strategies were discussed. A strong, citywide network is helpful in coordinating care linkage services . These partnerships will be critical in effectively realizing the goals of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy.

AB- HIV prevalence amongst 15–19 year olds in South Africa is 6.7% and 2.5% in females and males respectively. Using an interviewer-administered cross-sectional survey, we examined individual, interpersonal, family and community factors associated with sexual activity and condom use among 506 adolescents 16–18 years from Soweto, Johannesburg. The sample was mainly female (59%, n = 298). Using multivariate logistic regression, males (OR: 2.6, CI: 1.4–4.8), older partners (OR: 4.5, CI: 1.5–13.8), hazardous alcohol use (OR: 2.4, CI: 1.1–5.2) and permissive attitudes about sex (OR: 1.6, CI: 1.3–2.1) predicted sexual activity. A first partner at a younger age (OR: 1.2, CI: 1.1–1.4) and having older partners (OR: 0.29, CI: 0.13–0.68) predicted lack of condom use. For females, increasing age (OR: 2.7 CI:1.4-5.5), older partners (OR: 3.3 CI:1.4-7.6), and permissive attitudes about sex (OR: 1.6 CI:1.2– 2.1) predicted sexual activity. Multiple levels have to be addressed in developing HIV prevention programs for adolescents in Soweto. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- This study examines the relationship between masculine ideology, adherence to norms, and HIV prevention among young Black heterosexual and gay men on the campus of a historically Black college/university. The data from four focus groups and nine individual interviews (N = 35) were aggregated and two recurring themes emerged: sexual communication and mate availability. Additional themes related to HIV prevention were stigma, protection, and testing. The importance of investigating masculinity with young men is highlighted and implications for professionals working with college students to prevent the transmission of HIV are included.

AB- Young men who have sex with men (MSM) experience multiple health disparities, including alcohol and drug use, partner violence, victimization due to sexual orientation, and HIV infection. Syndemic theorists explain the clustering of these disparities among adult MSM as a result of cultural marginalization. To date, research on a similar emerging syndemic among young MSM has been limited to quantitative studies. The authors seek to better understand these disparities, and how they may cluster together, via qualitative interviews with 21 ethnically diverse, HIV-infected young MSM aged 18 to 24 years. These youth report a lack of gay-specific HIV prevention education, absence of role models, and lack of productive future goal-related activities as factors related to their acquisition of HIV and downplay substance use as a factor. Although not necessarily the components traditionally cited by syndemic theorists, these findings support the notion that multiple factors of cultural marginalization cluster together in the lives of young MSM and underscore the importance of community-level interventions, such as sexual health education, access to mentors, and assistance with future goal setting and planning.

Rates of exposure to each form of abuse was high; 33% reported sexual assault, 74% reported at least one type of physical violence, and 91% reported at least one type of emotional abuse. Co-occurring trauma was the dominant pattern. Sexual assault and number of types of trauma experienced were associated with inconsistent condom use. Physical violence and number of types of trauma experienced were associated with depression and substance abuse. Implications for intervention are discussed.

AB- On the heels of several trials demonstrating the efficacy of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and the recent approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration of the supplemental indication for emtricitabine–tenofovir as PrEP, researchers, advocates, and community providers are calling for the investigation of implementation strategies that combine behavioral interventions with biomedical prevention. The authors describe the modification and integration of an evidence-based group-level intervention into a small PrEP pilot trial with young men who have sex with men. The behavioral intervention and ongoing risk reduction counseling sessions were found to be highly acceptable among a sample of racially diverse young men who have sex with men.

AB- Disease knowledge is an important component of medication self-management. We examined HIV knowledge and understanding among 166 HIV-infected 13- to 21-year-olds (53% female, 72.9% African American, 59.6% perinatally infected). Behaviorally infected youth outperformed perinatally infected youth on HIV transmission knowledge and were more likely to report provider discussions about getting condoms and how drugs impair sexual decision making. While youth accurately answered most (78%) true/false questions, many could not define resistance (71.0%), viral load (59.0%), or CD4 (43.4%). Only 29.5% reported knowing either their CD4 count or viral load. Provider discussions about biomarkers likely contribute to greater HIV knowledge and understanding, especially for youth with lower CD4 counts, perhaps because illness triggers extended provider discussions.

AB- In this study, the authors aimed to understand providers’ role in delivering HIV transmission prevention counseling to youth living with HIV (YLWH). Fourteen in-depth interviews were conducted with providers in Kinshasa, DRC. Providers’ lack of knowledge and comfort in talking to youth about sex because of cultural and religious beliefs about sexuality, coupled with confusion about legal issues related to youth and contraception, made it difficult for them to effectively counsel youth. For providers to deliver effective prevention counseling to YLWH, clinics should follow adolescent-friendly clinic standards, provide counseling in an adolescent-friendly style, and institute an effective referral system for additional prevention services. HIV prevention services can be improved through the creation of an adolescent-friendly environment and by providing “values clarification” and skill-based trainings so that providers are able to assess the role of their own beliefs and learn new skills.

AB- Developing theory-driven and culturally appropriate support for treatment adherence is critical to positive health outcomes in adolescents and emerging adults living with HIV/AIDS. Romanian young long-time HIV survivors represent a special population requiring urgent assessment of specific adherence-support needs. The authors adapted the Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills (IMB) model of adherence to this population via thematic analysis of data from focus groups with service users and medical professionals. In addition to adherence-relevant themes identified in previous IMB-model research, new themes such as the role of informational conflicts, long-term goals and altruistic motivation emerged as important factors in this sample of long-term nosocomially infected young adults.

AB- This editorial provides an overview of the present issue of Journal of HIV/AIDS & Social Services with special emphasis on domestic and international perspectives on prevention, treatment, and intervention development for the prevention of AIDS in adolescents and emerging adults. Adolescence is a time often marked by experimentation, risk taking, and vulnerability in the development of racial, sexual, and social identities and the social drivers of risk and vulnerability among adolescents have been theorized in a number of ways. A diverse range of articles in terms of setting, study population, and methodology were selected for this special issue. Included are both domestic and international studies that address secondary prevention needs of youth living with HIV/AIDS including research involving nosocomially, perinatally, and behaviorally infected youth as well as studies that investigate risk and protective factors among HIV-negative populations. Certain articles describe the testing and adaptation of interventions to better meet the needs of special populations, including adherence in HIV-positive youth and young MSM in preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) trials, as well as quality of care assessment in sexual risk reduction counseling.

AB- This article discusses the prioritizing directions for future HIV prevention research for adolescents. The HIV epidemic among adolescents continues to exact a heavy toll in suffering, morbidity, mortality, and expenditures in fiscal and human resources, both in the United States and globally, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Most importantly, various programs have demonstrated programmatic efficacy in reducing HIV-associated sexual and drug use behaviors and reducing new HIV infections. A vaccine is not in the foreseeable future, and, even assuming a vaccine were to become available, it may require multiple doses and may not be 100% effective at preventing HIV acquisition. In addition, some adolescents who might benefit from vaccination may elect to not adopt the vaccine or may not be able to be vaccinated without parental permission. Thus, from my perspective, there is a clear, cogent, and compelling urgency to intensify HIV prevention efforts. Prevention efforts need to be tailored to accommodate the social realities and needs of adolescents living with HIV who continue to engage in transmission behaviors, as well as adolescents who are HIV negative but engage in HIV-associated behaviors.

Results of binary logistic regression indicated that (a) the majority of the participants socialized outside of their home neighborhoods; (b) 13- to 20-year-olds utilized social circles to meet casual sex partners significantly more than 21- to 29-year-olds, who were more likely to make use of mainstream gay venues for this purpose; and (c) the participants who met sex partners at mainstream gay venues were less likely to engage in unprotected anal sex than those who partnered via the Internet.

The authors examined the development of a new community-based HIV/AIDS prevention intervention and its impact on participants’ HIV/AIDS-related knowledge, condom-use intentions, sexual behavior, and HIV testing status. Results indicated that the intervention had a significant impact regarding increased HIV/AIDS-related knowledge, decreased instances of unprotected sex, and increased likelihood of getting tested for HIV. Policy implications and recommendations for future research are also discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- In this study, the authors examined the effects of HIV optimism, closeness to someone with HIV/AIDS, self-esteem, and body image on sexual risk behavior of men who have sex with men (MSM) who reached sexual maturity after the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy. Online survey responses from 139 sexually active male participants were considered as a whole and for the subpopulation of males not in steady, monogamous relationships. Knowing someone with HIV/AIDS was related to lower levels of sexual risk taking. The aspect of body image related to weight was also an important factor in safer sex behavior, with perceptions of heavier bodies related to higher sexual risk taking. For single participants only, higher HIV optimism was related to greater sexual risk taking although likely as a function of retrospective justification. The findings from this unique exploratory study of young MSM are discussed in the context of implications for policy around current and future health campaigns.

AB- The current study was conducted to examine the impact of mixing genders in intervention groups targeted toward HIV-positive men and women. The gender composition of groups in a randomized clinical control trial was examined in relation to participant group attendance and group satisfaction measures. The regression model for men in the risk reduction condition was significant; however, the model was not significant for women in the same condition. The findings indicate that mixing genders in this intervention had no negative impact on women’s group satisfaction and may have positively impacted men’s group satisfaction. In practice, mixed-gender intervention groups can be a helpful option for delivering programs to diverse populations, especially when resources are limited within community-based organizations. Although more thorough investigation is needed, this study supports the idea that mixing genders may be a viable option in practice.

AB- In this study, the authors use a quasi-experimental pretest and posttest survey design to examine the effects of a course, called HIV/AIDS: Science, Behavior, and Society, on undergraduate students’ HIV knowledge, attitudes, and risky sexual behaviors. With the assistance of social work faculty, the course incorporates experiential learning pedagogy and a transdisciplinary perspective. Although the course was not designed as a prevention program, the theory of health behavior suggests the incorporation of experiential learning will impact crucial HIV/AIDS attitudes and behaviors. When regression models were applied, relative to the comparison group (N = 111), the HIV/AIDS class students (N = 79) reported an increase in posttest HIV knowledge, perceived susceptibility to HIV among females, and a reduction of risky sexual attitudes among sexually active students.

AB- The purpose of this research was to conduct a preliminary evaluation of the Abstinence and Contraception Education Storehouse (ACES), a digital, classroom-based resource designed to supplement existing sex education curricula with highly interactive materials such as video clips, multimedia polls and quizzes, and audiovisual demonstrations. Three hundred thirty-five students aged 14 to 19 were randomly assigned to an ACES-based (treatment) or a standard (control) sex education curriculum. Data were collected at the onset of the intervention and 3 months after the completion of the intervention. Preliminary results were highly encouraging, with ACES participants who were sexually initiated at baseline reporting (at the 3-month follow-up) significant reductions in the number of times they had sex in the past 4 weeks. Both sexually initiated and non–sexually initiated youth who experienced the ACES curriculum also demonstrated greater intent to abstain from the sex during the follow-up period than did those in the control group.

AB- The authors describe psychosocial outcomes of a group randomized controlled trial of a friendship-based HIV/sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevention intervention grounded in the AIDS Risk Reduction Model (ARRM). A total of 264 African American adolescent girls were randomized to a single-session Project ÒRÉ HIV/STI prevention intervention or a nutrition/exercise health promotion intervention with their friendship group. At posttest, Project ÒRÉ participants scored higher on knowledge of HIV/STI prevention and protection (p &lt; .01), knowledge of living with HIV/STI (p &lt; .01), perceived HIV risk (p &lt; .05), perceived STI risk (p &lt; .01), and intentions to use condoms for vaginal sex (p &lt; .05). Findings suggest that a brief friendship-based HIV/STI prevention intervention for youth can impact ARRM factors that increase the ability to recognize and label risky sexual behaviors as problematic and promote commitment to changing high-risk behaviors.

AB- The Health Belief Model is a path analytical framework that identifies risk perception among other variables as very crucial to safer sexual behaviors. Yet, very few studies have examined what influences risk perception itself and the simultaneity of the relationship between risk perception and sexual behaviors. Using data from the Cape Area Panel Survey and applying multilevel path models, this study examined what influences risk perception and sexual behaviors, focusing on the complexities of the relationship between the two variables. The study also examined the effects of poverty at the community level on risk perception and sexual behaviors. Results indicate a negative relationship between risk perception and sexual risk-taking. At the community level, poverty impacts sexual risk-taking positively but risk perception negatively. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- We assessed how self-assessed spirituality and frequency of worship influenced HIV-preventive behaviors among single minority 18- to 39-year-olds living in high AIDS prevalence areas of Broward County, Florida. Eligible residents participated in telephone surveys conducted in 2001 and 2002. Most (83.8%) said they considered themselves spiritual persons. Many (45.2%) worshipped every week. Most weekly worshippers (66.1%) were sexually active but were less likely to have used a condom in the past year or to have ever been tested for HIV. To improve HIV-preventive behaviors, we collaborate with places of worship and faith-based organizations to provide culturally congruent HIV/AIDS services.

AB- Even with the medicalization of HIV/AIDS, bringing programs and services into communities requires effective programs and service delivery systems. Developing and maintaining the capacities of these programs are critical. Because capacity building has become such an important part of HIV prevention work, greater attention must be given to the best practices in this area. In this article, the best practices and lessons learned from one national capacity building initiative are presented. Using a nonexperimental approach, the authors present 4 years of capacity building assistance service provision in the field of HIV prevention.

AB- Statistics show that African American women account for 64% of all HIV/AIDS cases reported in 2005 compared with White women (19%) and Hispanic women (15%) (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2005). Typically, HIV/AIDS research focuses on prevention for high-risk minority women and men who have sex with men (MSM), while young Black college women are ignored as a risk group. This study examined factors that influence HIV risk behaviors among a sample of 189 young Black women aged 18-24 from a Historically Black University. Participants completed self-administered questionnaires that asked about their condom use with either a boyfriend or casual sex partner in the preceding 12 months, as well as their substance use and condom use self-efficacy. Results indicated that the type of sexual relationship in which the participants were involved and their self-efficacy are positively associated with their condom use. Substance use was negatively associated with condom use. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Although there have been national advances in HIV prevention, early detection of HIV, and early treatment of HIV, urban communities in the United States remain disproportionately impacted by HIV/AIDS. Urban communities with populations over 500,000 in the United States account for 84.6% of cumulative AIDS cases (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2006). Certain communities in New York, such as Harlem and Washington Heights, are an example of an urban community that continues to experience disproportionately high HIV transmission rates (New York State Department of Health [NYS DOH], 2006). What are the unique sociocultural challenges that have obstructed recent HIV education efforts (CDC, 2006)? This article reports on the findings of a pilot study (n = 46) that sought to identify the sociocultural challenges to HIV education and prevention among clients at numerous inner city HIV/AIDS community-based organizations in New York City. Critical findings include why clients selected certain agencies (the locale) and what they thought was the most effective HIV education tool (accessible HIV/AIDS reading material).

AB- This study evaluated the effectiveness of the Sisters Informing Sisters about Topics on AIDS (SISTA) curriculum against an enhanced SISTA curriculum that included additional information about the relationship between drug use and HIV risk. The intervention aimed to reduce and prevent alcohol- and drug-related behaviors that negatively impact sexual decision making, such as having unprotected sex. It was hypothesized that the enhanced SISTA curriculum would lead to greater awareness of HIV risk and subsequently more consistent condom use. Participants were 260 young adult African American females, who identified as heterosexual. Measures of HIV knowledge and condom use were collected at pretest, posttest, and/or 3-month follow-up. The enhanced SISTA intervention demonstrated greater effectiveness than did the standard SISTA intervention in promoting HIV knowledge at posttest and subsequent condom use at 3-month follow-up. Implications for including drug education in HIV prevention efforts are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Twenty-five years into the HIV/AIDS pandemic, significant health outcome disparities and gaps in culturally congruent strategies continue to exist for historically underserved racial/ethnic populations (i.e., African American/Black, Latino/Hispanic, and American Indian/Alaska Native and Asian/Pacific Islander). Racial/ethnic minorities account for more than 73% of new HIV infections. For this special issue, we sought—and found—articles reporting on culturally congruent models and/or approaches that should be considered in prevention and intervention with historically underserved populations, specifically for this issue—African American and Latino populations. What we found, and what we now share, is work that confirms the need for responsive, community specific interventions and outreach. We found work that compels attention and education to new generations of young people. We found researchers providing practical lessons learned and directions for future collaborative work between university researchers, community institutions and stakeholder groups, and identified communities of African American and Latino populations.

AB- Reports an error in "Mass incarceration: The HIV/AIDS epidemic and the Affordable Care Act―What will the future hold" by Robert E. Fullilove and Danielle E. Rosen (Journal of HIV/AIDS & Social Services, 2014[Jan], Vol 13[1], 5-7). In Volume 13, Issue 1 of Journal of HIV=AIDS & Social Services, the incorrect middle initial was listed for Danielle R. Rosen, co-author of the Commentary, ‘‘Mass Incarceration: The HIV =AIDS Epidemic and the Affordable Care Act— What Will the Future Hold?,’’ pp. 5–7. The correct name is presented in the erratum. The publisher would like to apologize for this error. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2014-08847-002[/rid].) This article maintains that fifty years from today, historians are likely to look back on this era and describe it as a time of great promise, great possibilities, and great challenges. It is argued that nowhere are the conditions of promise, possibilities, and challenges more evident than in an analysis of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and its (potential) impact on the HIV/AIDS epidemic. As the epidemic rages into its third decade, it is increasingly thriving on and at home in the pockets of disadvantage and inequality that dot the American landscape. Additionally, it increasingly impacts those who are also at risk for being homeless and who are likely engaged with ongoing interactions with the criminal justice system. Disaster scenarios and worst case scenarios have been part of the HIV/AIDS epidemic since it was first recognized in 1981. Future historians will be fascinated and intrigued by the efforts to mainstream care for those caught up in this epidemic. Those who work in HIV see the imperative to ensure that this happens with, perhaps, greater clarity than anyone else. But that ending requires action now, and becoming engaged in the political and logistical struggles of ACA is now a top item on the future agenda of those of us for whom HIV remains very much a part of our challenges for the present.

AB- Reviews the book, AIDS at 30: A History by V. A. Harden (2012). This book is a fascinating story spanning 30 years from the first reports of "a new illness" in 1981 to June 5, 2011, when the world observed the 30th anniversary of the disease known as acquired immune deficiency syndrome, or AIDS. The book also includes illustrative diagrams, maps, a glossary, additional notes, and an epilogue that are helpful. Her style is engaging and bias free. Although much of the book is devoted to biomedical writings about AIDS, there is some interesting documentation for social work and social service professionals, too. It was a great revelation to me that AIDS-related stigma, discrimination, coyness in mentioning sexual behaviors even in formal meetings, initial denial at country level, back and forth in policy formulation, and so on were witnessed both in the industrialized, developed world and the developing countries. This book is a must read for the social science and humanities audience, the efforts of the program director have been richly praised all over the world for establishing AIDS programs in more than 100 countries in a short span of time. All of these country programs had components of awareness building, counseling, and psychosocial support trainings, but we do not see the discussion of the same in this book.

AB- Due to recent changes in New Zealand’s HIV and immigration situations, there is a growing need to understand the lives of HIV-positive African newcomers there, including how and when they encounter HIV stigma and discrimination. To illuminate the experience of these individuals, interviews with 13 African immigrants or refugees in New Zealand described difficulties with and causes of HIV stigma and decisions about disclosure of HIV diagnosis. The continued presence of stigma suggests that more work must be done on HIV education, privacy enforcement, antistigma campaigns, culturally competent care, and enforcement of existing human rights laws.

AB- The purpose of this qualitative study was to understand whether HIV-positive persons experience stigma in relation to HIV/AIDS and how it has impacted their lives and that of their families. Ethnographic techniques were used to collect data from Kerala, India. The findings were organized into three themes: (a) physical appearance and HIV-related stigma; (b) the “informed” and the “ignorant”: knowledge and ignorance in the context of HIV/AIDS; and (c) immorality as a perceived cause of HIV infection and the family context. The study highlighted the need to develop a more nuanced understanding of HIV-related stigma that extends beyond the current conceptualization of stigma.

In response to the growing number of orphans, governments, civil society, and international organizations have implemented programs to provide protection, care, and support to these children. However, few of these programs have assessed their effectiveness. The Cameroon Baptist Convention Health Service Chosen Children Program provides home-based services, which include HIV screening, payment of school fees and medical care, nutritional assistance, psychosocial support and counseling, and monitoring through home visitation. Quantitative and qualitative data are provided that show that orphans served by the Chosen Children’s Program stayed within their family homes, were in school longer, and achieved more school success than did orphans not receiving services.

AB- Successes in diagnosing and treating pediatric HIV have necessitated care that extends beyond basic medical needs. However, capacity for providing childhood psychosocial support (PSS) remains limited. Programmatic research with young PLHIV, care providers and parents in Uganda and South Africa explored challenges in meeting the psychosocial needs of HIV-positive children. Three areas for childhood PSS were examined: disclosure, stigma, and grief/bereavement. This research identified programming gaps, strategies and good practices in five focal areas: providing immediate postdiagnosis support, stigma reduction, capacity building, addressing grief, and promoting peer support. Recommendations are presented for enhancing PSS for HIV-positive children in resource-limited settings. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Marijuana use has been documented to be higher among emerging adults than among other age groups in the United States. Persons living with HIV may use marijuana as a method for alleviating symptoms and side effects associated with treatment as well as a coping or mood adjustment strategy. The authors analyzed data from a two-phase mixed methods study of young HIV-positive gay/bisexual men to explore motivations for heavy marijuana use. Phase I consisted of semistructured qualitative interviews with 54 young gay/bisexual HIV-positive men (mean age 21.0 years) conducted at four geographically and demographically diverse sites. Phase II consisted of a computer-assisted quantitative survey administered to 200 young gay/bisexual HIV-positive men (mean age 21.1 years) across 14 clinical sites within the ATN. Phase I participants described marijuana use chiefly within the contexts of responses to initial HIV diagnosis, stress relief, and relaxation, including active and avoidant coping techniques. Phase II results revealed that almost one-quarter (23%) of the sample reported smoking marijuana every day, and another 16% said they smoked at least weekly but not daily. Logistic regression analysis determined significant predictors of at least weekly marijuana use to be using substances to relieve the stress of living with HIV (β = 1.04, p &lt; .01), using substances alone (β = 2.05, p &lt; .01), and using substances to reduce side effects of medication (β = 2.44, p &lt; .01). Heavy marijuana use in our quantitative sample greatly exceeded rates reported in population-based studies of emerging adults and in previous studies of medicinal marijuana among persons living with HIV. These data have implications for self-care strategies among young persons living with HIV and intervention development for this population.

AB- Cross-sectional analyses of 904 diverse men and women aged 50 years and older living with HIV in New York City were conducted to examine the unique experiences and needs of aging HIV-positive individuals. Using Minority Stress Theory and Syndemic Theory as guiding paradigms, the authors documented the mental health burdens of the sample with regard to depression, loneliness, and diminished psychological well-being and examined how multiple-minority status and HIV-related stigma explained these burdens. Mediation modeling demonstrated that the effects of minority stressors on mental health burden were mediated by HIV-related stigma. The mediation was significant for the overall sample and for the male subsample. Results suggest that to fully address the mental health burdens experienced by aging HIV-positive individuals, we must continue to address mental health burdens directly, and at the same time, look beyond the psychiatric symptoms to address the structural inequities faced by individuals based on their multiple-minority status.

AB- This editorial provides an overview of the collection of articles featured in this issue of the Journal of HIV/AIDS & Social Services. These article discusses about HIV/AIDS, stigma and discrimination. This issue explores the phenomenon of HIV stigma on both the local level and the global level. One of the article addresses the circumstances surrounding heavy marijuana use among young gay and bisexual men. The other article presents a study conducted to psychosocial care needs for vulnerable children in Uganda and South Africa. Based on interviews and focus groups with children, families, other caregivers, and professional staff, they found that stigma and discrimination were major concerns along with disclosure issues and grief. A quasi-experimental, mixed-methods study is presented in which the authors assessed whether an experimental group of assisted orphans resided with their family caregivers and remained in school longer than those not receiving services. Further an article presents a qualitative study of people living with HIV/AIDS in Kerala, India. Through interviews with both men and women of mainly lower socioeconomic levels, the authors bring to light the complex issue of stigma in Kerala. Hope this set of articles updates the readership about stigma and discrimination across the globe and the life cycle. HIV stigma, discrimination, and marginalization are indeed enduring and experienced worldwide in the lives of people living with HIV and those who care for them.

AB- A total of 181 HIV/AIDS counselors in Botswana, Africa, were surveyed about their satisfaction with their training and supervision, self-perceived clinical effectiveness as counselors, social stigma encountered, emotional and psychological reactions to counseling HIV-positive clients, and barriers to effective counseling. The majority of HIV/AIDS counselors indicated satisfaction with the quality of the training received, perceived themselves as effective counselors, were relatively untroubled by social stigma issues, and perceived few barriers to effective counseling. A large percentage of the counselors received 8 weeks or less of formal training, generally received little or no in-service supervision, and experienced stress and burnout. Many counselors also felt that they had too many clients to be effective and that they had inadequate access to learning materials. Recommendations included the need to provide regular and clinical in-service training experiences, training for clinical supervision, and the development of uniform counseling standards.

AB- The purpose of this study was to describe patient perceptions of two different electronic personal health records for patients living with HIV/AIDS in New York City. Seven focus groups were conducted with a total of 54 patient participants. Focus group participants anticipated benefits including increased patient responsibility, health awareness, efficiency, security, and provider benefits (e.g., time savings). Concerns and barriers related to password recall, computer access, and computer literacy. Future research efforts are needed to further delineate the personal health records features and functions necessary to meet the complex health care, social service, and self-management needs of low-income populations of patients living with HIV/AIDS, design effective strategies to overcome barriers to personal health records use, and evaluate the impact of personal health records use on patient empowerment, shared decision making, and HIV-related patient outcomes.

AB- While HIV shows no discrimination, the Haitian American community is overrepresented among groups affected by HIV/AIDS and yet remains underserved in health care and social services. The purpose of this study is to explore the met and unmet health care needs of Haitian Americans living with HIV/AIDS. This study reports the findings of an in-depth qualitative study that explored the experiences of 150 Haitian Americans infected with or affected by HIV. Findings indicated misinformation on HIV/AIDS, distrust for service providers among the participants, stigma impacts health-seeking behavior, and a need for providing culturally informed services. To ensure that Haitian Americans living with HIV/AIDS access appropriate services, health care providers need to ensure their programs and staff address cultural attitudes, beliefs, and expectations. In particular, clinicians should demonstrate respect; provide confidentiality and privacy, and address language barriers, transportation needs, housing, and family needs.

AB- Indiana, with an estimated 9,282 persons living with HIV/AIDS in 2008, was selected to participate in the Medical Monitoring Project. The Medical Monitoring Project is a surveillance system designed to generate representative data on persons living with HIV/AIDS who are receiving care in Indiana. The authors sought to answer: What obstacles exist today among persons receiving HIV medical care? What impact do these have on treatment and services? Of 451 participants sampled, 349 reported at least one service need during the past year and 164 (47.0%) of those participants reported at least one service need was unmet. Overall, reported unmet needs was significantly associated (p &lt; .034) with a lower likelihood of “always” taking HIV medications. The study results indicate that obstacles to treatment adherence involve unmet needs commonly found among HIV-infected persons receiving care. Interventions to improve treatment adherence involve community service assessments, client awareness, linkage to services, and provider awareness of existing barriers.

AB- Research on older HIV-positive (HIV+) adults finds that minorities with HIV are less educated and report less stable incomes than whites with HIV and the general population. This study assesses to what extent perceived financial hardships contributes to life satisfaction for HIV+ aging African Americans. Participants were 377 African American HIV+ individuals over age 50 (35% women) living in New York City. A three-step hierarchical linear regression analysis indicated that perceived financial strain for aging HIV+ African Americans is a significant and independent predictor of life satisfaction (p &lt; .001). Outreach to African Americans aging with HIV should consider how financial strain is associated with life satisfaction. Outreach should also address systemic economic disparities for African American communities that have high infection rates and a greater number of people living with HIV; these communities face a burden towards accessing effective health care and preventative care that is partially driven by limited economic resources.

AB- Stigma has been a major barrier to accessing HIV prevention, care, and treatment services. This study seeks to assess the effect of stigma on self-reported adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and self-confidence to take medication correctly among HIV-infected adults in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. A descriptive cross-sectional study using both quantitative and qualitative data was carried out at Zewditu Memorial Hospital’s HAART clinic. Self-reported Morisky scale was used to assess adherence to HAART, and Berger stigma scale was used to measure the level of perceived stigma. The three measures of stigma (negative self-image, concern about public attitude, and concern about disclosure) were negatively associated with self-reported adherence to HAART and with self-confidence to take medication correctly. In order to improve adherence, programs that address stigma need to be designed and implemented. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- In this prospective, randomized clinical trial, correlates of adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) were assessed using a baseline questionnaire among 68 rural women living with AIDS (WLA) in India. Unadjusted analyses revealed positive relationships of ART adherence with Hindu religion and support from spouses and parents, whereas negative associations were found with depression, poor quality of life, and having 10 or more HIV symptoms. Multiple linear regression analysis also revealed that WLA who were Hindu, not depressed, had ART support from spouses and parents, and perceived some benefit from ART, were more adherent to ART than their respective counterparts. This study reveals the unique challenges which rural WLA experience and the need to mitigate these challenges early in ART treatment. Further, the findings enable the refinement of an intervention program that will focus on strengthening ART adherence among rural WLA.

AB- A successful program response to the HIV/AIDS pandemic requires the targeting of high-risk groups. However, when HIV prevalence is high throughout the population—as it is in Malawi—the need exists to cover the entire country. The authors examine the ability of the Malawi program to achieve national coverage. A major obstacle is that very few civil society groups, which are the main implementation agents, factor coverage into their programming. Rather than expanding their coverage, they extend their activities within their traditional catchment area to serve as many people as possible. Thus, it is necessary to clarify the division of labor between government and civil society, so that together they can respond in a coverage-sensitive manner.

AB- The purpose of this study was to examine which factors derived from an adapted version of the Health Belief Model are associated with HIV testing among women at domestic violence shelters in the rural south (N = 112). Participants were administered self-report questionnaires to assess for test acceptance and were offered private and free HIV rapid testing. A logistic regression analysis was performed. Results indicated that higher perceived susceptibility and higher posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms predicted a greater likelihood of HIV test acceptance. The most common reason given for not testing was a lack of time. Implications are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- As HIV/AIDS mortality rates improve, more and more HIV-infected parent(s) are bearing HIV-negative children. Using a comprehensive national medical cost data, this study compared the health care expenditures (prescription and nonprescription) of HIV-affected and non-HIV-affected children, with a special focus on the impact of mental health conditions on expenditures. Post matching, multivariate analysis showed the HIV-affected children’s prescription expenditures are significantly less compared to non-HIV-affected children. However, HIV-affected children with mental health conditions incurred greater: total health care expenditures (4.0 times), nonprescription health care expenditures (3.1 times), and prescription expenditures (8.7 times) compared to the respective expenditures of other children in the study.

AB- In 2004, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention named the Baton Rouge, Louisiana, metropolitan area, in a tie with Miami, Florida, the second highest for new cases of AIDS per capita in the nation. This study uses the Baton Rouge case to suggest improvements to sense-making theory. It posits that complementing sense-making’s traditional qualitative approach with quantitative analyses will improve long-term community-based health-promotion campaigns by uncovering HIV=AIDS knowledge gaps that exist between groups and within individuals about their own risk for the disease. As the results show, many similarities were indeed found, but some differences also emerged. This triangulation approach is important in creating health communication messages that are effective with the entire population.

AB- African American men who have sex with men often experience rejection and discrimination. Mental illness may contribute to high HIV risk behavior. We assessed the relationship between mental illness and HIV risk among African American men who have sex with men. We assessed 125 African American men who have sex with men aged 18 years or older in Ohio for mental illness, substance use, HIV knowledge, and risk. Bivariate analyses were conducted. Any mental illness was associated with substance abuse (p = .001), child abuse (p = .032), suicide attempts (p = .028), and trading sex for money or drugs (p = .002). Bipolar disorder was associated with trading sex for money or drugs (p = .008). Mood disorders appear undertreated among African American men who have sex with men. More adequate mental health and substance abuse treatment are needed both in the prison system and the community setting to reduce HIV risk and transmission.

AB- Data collected from 224 women living with HIV were analyzed to study quality of life. Quality of life was operationalized as mental health and physical functioning. A structural equation model was tested. The final model demonstrates good fit to data (χ² = 17.63, p = .48). Mental health was directly and positively associated with being born outside of Canada, social support, and physical functioning but negatively associated with the proportion of people aware of serostatus and experienced discrimination. Physical functioning was directly and positively associated with being born outside of Canada and social support; however, it was negatively associated with time since diagnosis. The proportion of people aware of serostatus was negatively associated with being born outside of Canada and being a mother. Social work interventions aimed at improving quality of life in women living with HIV should target contexts of serostatus disclosure to minimize HIV discrimination and to improve social support sources without compromising existing ones.

AB- In this study, the authors explored the perception and strategies used by 20 injecting drug users (IDUs) as they regularly confront life-threatening complications stemming from their drug use. The 20 IDUs were from four urban centers of Nepal: Kathmandu Valley, Pokhara, Narayanghaat, and Hetauda. The phenomenological study was conducted, using individual in-depth interviews ranging from 1 to 2 hours in length. All data were analyzed using the analytical approaches of grounded theory. It was found that the urgency and severity of withdrawal symptoms are the major precursors, leading drug users to share unsterile syringes and needles and thereby increasing the risks of HIV transmission and other health risks. The study also found that IDUs seemed aware and worried about HIV and other health risks, prompting them to devise their own seemingly suitable strategies for harm minimization. Understanding these high-risk strategies should inform public health and intensive harm-reduction services to be considered and implemented in Nepal. Attempts should be made to keep the IDUs in touch with suitable medication-assisted therapies to overcome the withdrawal symptoms, thus minimizing the chance of sharing syringes/needles with other IDUs.

AB- During the summer of 2012, world press news releases documented a corroborated case of the ‘‘Berlin patient’’ in Germany apparently cured of HIV/AIDS. While those of us in the field for decades recall many earlier reports of ‘‘cures’’, the data from this case appear credible with promising lines of research and treatment to follow. Treatment innovations are essential but require substantial infrastructure and resources. While work continues in treatment, prevention initiatives continue to have an ever relevant and increasing role. As social workers committed to research and practice in HIV/AIDS, we need to be informed—and active— in both realms of treatment and prevention. Further, there are social work roles in both treatment and prevention, and an impending merging of treatment as prevention. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- This study explores utilization of treatment for HIV and barriers to care among 22 low-income adults of color who were hospitalized at an urban medical center in New York City. A semistructured interview assessing use of medical care and adherence to HIV medications, psychosocial stressors (e.g., social support, substance abuse, and mental health need), and logistical, perceptual, and environmental barriers to treatment was administered during the participants’ hospital stay. Results showed that most of the sample had a regular source of outpatient care; however, very few were consistently connected to services. Further, the majority of respondents either skipped dosages or was not taking HIV medications all together. Untreated mental health and substance abuse difficulties, competing needs (e.g., housing, economic), unsafe living environments, negative views of treatment, and lack of social support were cited as contributing to treatment underuse. These findings suggest highly disadvantaged populations face innumerable obstacles to consistent receipt of needed care: implications and potential methods to intervene are discussed.

AB- The purpose of this community-based research was to examine the experiences of Canadian Aboriginal youth regarding accessing HIV testing and care services. We used a mixed method exploratory research design; 413 participants completed a self-administered survey and 25 youth participated in in-depth semistructured interviews. Findings reported here are from the 26 survey participants (12.4%) and nine interview participants (28.9%) who self-reported being positive for HIV. Results of this study suggest that some Aboriginal youth do not test for HIV until late in the course of their disease, and once diagnosed, a significant number of youth delay accessing care. Support from friends, family, and others is an important motivator for youth to initiate care and treatment. Integrated, comprehensive, youth-friendly, and culturally safe services are important to keep youth in care. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Drawing on the social capital literature, we hypothesized that civic engagement, as measured by participation in lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender–related community activities, would be an important protective factor with respect to sexual risk behavior. Accordingly, we examined the association between participation and three measures of risky sexual behavior in a group of men who have sex with men (MSM) who were part of the four-city, 1996–1998 Urban Men’s Health Study. In these analyses, we used the subsample of adult MSM who reported same-gender sex in the past year and were not HIV positive (N = 1857). Compared to those reporting no civic participation, those with the lowest and highest levels of participation were no more likely to engage in risky sexual behavior, but those with the second highest level had an increased likelihood of risky sexual behavior. Abstention from drugs, having a male primary partner, higher income, a college degree, and being older than 29 years of age all reduced the odds of risky sexual behavior among MSM.

AB- The recent global focus on the promotion of faith-based health and social interventions requires two major empirical data sets: (a), an understanding of how the health needs of churches relate to the assets they hold and (b) the collective capacity of members to use needed resources to help address a wide range of health issues including HIV/AIDS that continue to challenge many African countries’ already limited health-related resources. In this study, we hypothesized that if Nigerian churches have less stated perceived needs in relation to more perceived assets that could be used for HIV/AIDS prevention and control, they would have greater collective efficacy and engage in more HIV/AIDS prevention and control activities. Estimates of churches’ perceived needs, assets, collective efficacy, and activities as reported by church members from 81 Nigerian churches were aggregated. The linear regression method was used to test if needs and assets predicted collective efficacy and HIV/AIDS activities. The sum of church needs was positively related to collective efficacy (p &lt; .01) and assets and collective efficacy predicted more HIV/AIDS–related activities (p &lt; .01). Churches that had more members with a university education and those who had longer average church membership times had lower reported HIV/AIDS–related activity. The unexpected positive relationship between needs and collective efficacy in this cross-sectional study could be the result of those with higher collective efficacy having thought more about how to engage in HIV/AIDS prevention and control activities and, thus, being more aware of their needs.

AB- African American churches are potential sites of culturally relevant HIV prevention and service provision. A coalition including an ecumenical group of Christian clergy and lay leaders in the African American church community, a minority AIDS service organization, and an academic medical center, was funded to develop faith-based HIV education, prevention, and testing services. Before service implementation, coalition leaders conducted six focus groups with 46 different religious leaders and community members at risk for or living with HIV/AIDS, to understand program needs and collaboration strategies. Study participants identified key barriers and facilitators that are critical to the success of faith-based HIV/AIDS services.

AB- This issue of Journal of HIV/AIDS & Social Services focuses on the the impacts of two major HIV-related funding decisions across the United States (US). The first is the fiscal year (FY) 2011 US budget which implements a 0.2% across-the-board cut in nondefense discretionary programs. The second HIV-related funding change refers to the unfolding and emerging impact of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) latest funding opportunity announcement (FOA). The application of this funding formula is resulting in funding realignment that is based on the magnitude of the HIV epidemic within each jurisdiction. Other states and communities that have aggressive HIV or AIDS prevention programs have witnessed new case decreases in HIV diagnoses due to prevention programming. The consequences of the decisions are now beginning to be felt, and the impacts will be rapid and dramatic. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- These authors examine the nature and extent of fluidity in defining the typology of female sex work based on the place of solicitation or place of sex or both places together, and whether sex workers belonging to a particular typology are at increased risk of HIV in southern India. Data are drawn from a cross-sectional survey conducted during 2007–2008 among mobile female sex workers (N = 5301) in four Indian states. Findings from this study address an important policy issue: Should programmatic prevention interventions be spread to cover all places of sex work or be focused on a few places that cover a large majority of sex workers? Results indicate that most female sex workers, including those who are usually hard to reach such as those who are mobile or who use homes for soliciting clients or sex, can be reached programmatically multiple times by concentrating on a smaller number of categories, such as street-, lodge-, and brothel-based sex workers.

AB- To meet the HIV prevention needs of sex workers in India, some community-based organizations have begun integrating peer education and community mobilization into community-led structural interventions. As the role of community-based organizations continues to expand into new service areas, it is important to understand how these new interventions are received. This agency assessment was done in collaboration with Ashodaya Samithi in 2009. Ashodaya Samithi is a community-based organization led by female, male, and transgendered sex workers. In the past year, HIV-positive sex workers of Ashodaya have registered their own organization, known as Ashraya. Based on qualitative findings, this study describes how community-based organizations can play an important role in improving access to care and antiretroviral treatment for sex workers. The rapid growth of Ashraya and its success at fostering social solidarity and large-scale structural interventions hold valuable lessons for community-based organizations and public health practitioners working in the field of HIV/AIDS.

AB- Very little research has been conducted that examines the attitudes toward HIV/AIDS from the perspective of clients of sex workers. This study examined 13 male clients of sex workers through in-depth interviews that aimed to explore their understanding of risks associated with unprotected sex, as well as condom use and attitudes about condoms and HIV/AIDS. The findings suggested that clients of sex workers often have incorrect knowledge about HIV/AIDS. Additionally, differences arose around condom use with sex workers versus intimate partners. Finally, participants were found to deceive sex partners and intimate partners about their HIV/AIDS status. These findings emphasize the importance of more effective HIV/AIDS awareness programming aimed at male clients of sex workers.

AB- In Thailand, it is estimated that there are nearly 2 million female sex workers (FSWs), of whom 800,000 (40%) are under the age of 18 years. Studies examining condom use among adolescent FSWs in Thailand have been limited. Therefore, a survey was administered to a cross-sectional, nonrandomized sample of convenience among 130 adolescent, brothel-based FSWs in four geographic areas of Thailand. A condom utilization gap was evident in the present study, since on average adolescent FSWs used 3.8 condoms per day, while seeing 7.4 patrons per day. This is especially troubling since generalized condom utilization campaigns in the past have overlooked adolescent FSWs. Consequently, future public health efforts in Thailand need to recognize the existence and identify the unique healthcare needs of this vulnerable population, if they are to successfully decrease their sexually transmitted infection/HIV incidence rates.

AB- To investigate the role of powerlessness in elevated HIV risk among labor migrants, we compared internal verses external male migrant workers from Tajikistan using minimally structured interviews and focused field observations. The sample included 30 male labor migrants who traveled to work in Regar, Tajikistan (internal labor migrants), and 30 who travelled to work in Moscow, Russia (external labor migrants). Though powerlessness did not appear to account for whether labor migrants engaged in more HIV risk behaviors, the harsh living and working conditions of external labor migration impacted how the migrants manifested these HIV risks by amplifying group masculine norms and behaviors. Progress in preventing HIV infection amid the difficult social conditions of labor migration is contingent upon adequate conceptualization of how such conditions impact HIV risk behaviors (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- The aim of the study was to identify significant correlates of HIV-related risk behaviors using locus of control-based dimensions such as self-control, deferment of gratification, personal values, and social alienation. Participants in this study were university students who volunteered to participate in the study. The authors used correlations and linear regression to analyze the relationships between locus of control-based variables and HIV/AIDS risk. The results of the study found significant correlations between the locus of control-based variables and HIV/AIDS risk. Regression analysis indicated that the locus of control-based model, for example, deferment of gratification and personal values and expectancies explained a significant proportion of the variance in HIV/AIDS risk. Directions for future research could focus on locus of control-based models in predicting HI/AIDS risk among individuals in diverse population groupings.

AB- The need for the evaluation of community-based HIV prevention interventions among at-risk ethnoracial minority youth is warranted. A 5-day peer-led intervention was conducted among 201 at-risk youth aged 12 to 22 years old. We assessed ethnoracial and gender differences in sexual health knowledge, intention and ability to practice safe sex pre and post intervention. Participants were 57% male with a mean age of 16 years (50% Latino, 28% white, and 22% black). While participants in all ethnoracial groups showed improvement post intervention, black participants improved significantly less than whites in their intention to use condoms and HIV knowledge. Differences varied by baseline response. Results indicated that interventions may need enhancement in order to have a greater impact on ethnoracial minority youth.

The overall goal of the program was to involve mothers in HIV prevention efforts for their children. Three hundred six predominantly African American mothers and their children participated. Mothers attending the intervention were more likely to discuss sexuality-related topics and to state that they intended to discuss sexuality issues with their children at younger ages than did mothers in the control group. The study demonstrates that providing mothers with information and skills can increase their awareness of the need to provide age-appropriate sexuality education to their children, including specific information about HIV and its health consequences, and to encourage their children to adopt behaviors that reduce their chances of contracting HIV.

AB- To reverse increasing rates of HIV among African American women, intervention strategies need to be informed by their perceptions of HIV and HIV risk, and their recommendations for enhancing current interventions. In this focus group study, a community sample of African American women (n = 26) was asked to speak to these topics. Researchers conducted content analyses of focus group transcripts using Freire’s conscientization theory and Rosenstock’s Health Belief Model to articulate common themes from participants’ responses. Findings indicate that most participants were well-informed about their risk for contracting HIV, but saw more barriers than benefits in engaging in preventive health behaviors, and believed that their health, like the integrity of their environment, was largely beyond their control. Participants also saw an urgent need to step up intervention efforts with younger women, whom they believed were at high risk for contracting HIV. Discussion includes implications for policy and practice. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Recruitment and retention of participants remain a challenge to the implementation of behavioral HIV prevention programs. The aim of this article is to describe the process and challenges encountered while recruiting and retaining participants in the SISTA South Africa study in particular and to provide an understanding of the barriers to participation in a behavioral HIV prevention program among black HIV-negative women in general. Focus group discussions were conducted with HIV-negative women in three peri-urban townships in the Western Cape Province. The main barriers to participation were competing economic activities and domestic chores, the assumption that HIV prevention programs are mainly for HIV-positive women, HIV stigma, and uncertainties about HIV prevention programs. This study highlights advantages and pitfalls of recruiting from voluntary counseling and testing clinics and provides information for the development of meta-interventions to improve program participation.

AB- The development of an adolescent screening assessing risk of exposure to HIV/sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and its psychometric evaluation is described. An initial set of 31 items was administered to 1418 adolescents. Item and factor analyses resulted in an 18-item HIV/STD risk screening index. Reliability analysis indicated favorable evidence for index internal consistency (alpha = .86) and temporal stability over 6 to 10 days (r = .92). Construct validity was supported by the ability to use the index to differentiate between groups that differed in history of HIV/STD. Convergent validity was evidenced by significant correlations of the index with conceptually related measures. The screening index shows favorable psychometric evidence among diverse samples of adolescents. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- From the start, social workers made key contributions along with other health providers in developing knowledge and services to help those affected and infected and avoid future infections. HIV social work contains all of the challenges and satisfactions entailed throughout the social work profession due to the wide array of activities we perform as social workers—case management, other forms of direct clinical practice, supervision of social workers, professionals, and para-professionals, empowerment practice, program development, engaging stakeholders, participation in policy setting, and advocacy of every type, stripe, and category. Our work with individuals, families, groups, and communities uses the entire array of social work competencies, in terms of our abilities to assess needs on a variety of systems levels and identify resources to formulate and implement interventions. Social work, by our mission and our domain to address the psychosocial environment, will remain a critical player in addressing existing and emerging issues related to HIV. This journal provides a forum to document our successes and achievements as well as discuss the challenges we face as social workers concerned about HIV=AIDS care and support. Toward this end we hope to also use the journal to record our history as we move hopefully toward the next decades toward a world free of HIV.

The change in journal content alone over the years signals the advances that have made in the field of HIV. This edition examines facets that compose risk and preventive services: recruitment and retention, perceptions and beliefs about preventive services, reducing risk of exposure through sex education, prevention outcomes, and locus of control. It offers a number of fascinating and cutting edge articles. Noting the multitude of challenges faced at the dawn of the AIDS crisis, this issue points to the social work paradigm of the person-in-situation, our multiple-level skill sets, and our strengths approach that set us apart from other professionals as being uniquely prepared and capable not only to meet the challenges but also to invent practice when necessary.

AB- Reviews the book, Older Adults with HIV: An In-Depth Examination of an Emerging Population edited by M. Brennan, S. E. Karpiak, R. A. Shippy, and M. H. Cantor (2011). This book is the culmination of efforts of a well-established community-based organization (CBO) in New York City to collect and establish empirically valid normative data. The findings of in-depth analysis of the subgroups and thoughtful reflection based on what is already known about HIV and what is already known about aging are revealed in this book, as are descriptions of previously unmeasured population characteristics such as religiousness and spirituality, levels of loneliness, amount, type, and quality of social support, sexual behaviors, mental health, and rates of and type of status disclosure. Overall this research effort will undoubtedly be proved to be priceless as a baseline for future research as the population of adults over the age of 50 approaches an enormity never seen before, both in proportion and number, as people living with HIV are surviving due to massive successful medical efforts and as the incidence of people over age 50 acquiring HIV increases dramatically. It is a must-read for everyone interested in the subject. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- From 2004 through 2009, Family Health International engaged 270 Idirs—traditional burial societies—in Ethiopia’s fight against HIV and AIDS, which required the Idirs to change from only supporting death and mourning ceremonies to also supporting the living via mutual aid. Results show that more than 126,000 children received services and that these Idirs played a catalytic role in changing local attitudes away from discrimination and stigmatization and toward direct support for orphans, other vulnerable children, and people living with or affected by HIV infection. The achievements further demonstrate that, when capacitated, indigenous community-level organizations can become major partners in achieving lasting, transformational development at the grassroots level.

AB- This study examines stigmatization among immigrant and indigenous (a person whose parents were both born in the Netherlands) HIV-infected patients in the Netherlands. We interviewed 90 indigenous Dutch and 112 immigrant HIV-infected patients using the personalized stigma and disclosure concerns subscales of the HIV Stigma Scale. Use of these scales with HIV-infected immigrant patients was feasible as we found adequate reliability and patients were able to answer the questions after explanation. Personalized stigma was significantly higher among HIV-infected immigrants. Disclosure concerns were significantly higher among persons with an HIV transmission route other than men having sex with men. In multivariate analyses adjusting for age, sex, and number of years being HIV positive, having an immigrant status remained significantly associated with personalized stigma and HIV transmission routes other than men having sex with men remained significantly associated with having more disclosure concerns. Our findings suggest that social workers and counselors should be especially attentive to experienced and perceived HIV stigma among HIV-infected persons from these particular populations. Future studies should explore the mechanisms underlying stigmatization in the different subgroups so interventions to decrease stigmatization can be developed and examined.

AB- HIV-infected individuals experience high rates of mental health difficulties. This study examines archival chart data of HIV-infected individuals (N = 94; 54% African American) 2 years after initiating specialized psychiatric services (psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, or both) to (a) characterize demographic correlates of medical outcomes; (b) describe factors associated with continued psychiatric care at 2 years; and (c) compare medical outcomes for those who continued in psychiatric care and those who did not. Results indicated that there was higher emergency department use and medical hospitalizations among women, ethnic minorities, and heterosexual patients over 2 years. Physicians reported greater adherence problems among minority patients and unemployed individuals. Patients with a history of sexual or physical abuse and individuals with psychotic disorder diagnoses were more likely to remain in psychiatric treatment. Current psychotropic medication use was associated with (a) fewer comorbid health conditions; (b) use of more medications; (c) greater use of HIV medications; (d) fewer physician concerns about medication adherence; (e) lower frequency of an AIDS diagnosis; and (f) less frequent occurrence of a detectable viral load. While there were few differences between those who remained in specialized care and those who did not, patients who continued in treatment had fewer comorbid health conditions at 2 years. In summary, findings suggest differential health outcomes based on demographic characteristics and psychotropic medication use with few differences associated with continued specialized psychiatric care. Future research should seek to further examine mechanisms associated with the impact of ongoing psychiatric care on longitudinal medical outcomes among HIV-infected individuals.

AB- The purpose of this qualitative study was to develop a clearer understanding of the challenges and needs of long-term HIV/AIDS survivors living in rural and semirural areas, as well as to explore what factors and resources may be related to more effective coping. Eleven long-term HIV/AIDS survivors were invited to participate in this research through an AIDS service organization working in rural/semirural California towns. Each participant was interviewed using structured questions. The interviews were transcribed and analyzed using ATLAS.ti. Spirituality, having a sense of control, and social support were associated with more positive perceptions. Perceiving life as "better" or "worse" seemed unrelated to prediagnostic functioning for the majority of the participants. Coping seemed to have more to do with individual reactions than to actual life circumstances, health, or financial status. Interestingly, some of the most ill with the most limited incomes expressed the most optimistic perceptions of their lives. Similarly, while it was expected that persons living in rural areas would have more difficulties, the majority of our participants did not seem to perceive living in rural or semirural areas as barriers to services. A surprising finding was the number of participants who noted the stigma of disability related poverty as being more important than the stigma of having HIV/AIDS, being a homosexual, or having a mental illness.

AB- Recent federal initiatives focusing on people living with HIV have stressed the need for identification of HIV-positive persons as well as linking them to services and engaging them into the care system. Linking this population to care to treat them and also supporting them in the care situation may be critical not only to ensure adequate medical treatment but over the long run to reduce risk behavior and transmission on individual and community levels. In fact, the focus of HIV prevention and services, previously fairly separate, has shifted to a focus on test=treat=refer that includes case identification, testing, and integrating the HIV-positive person into the care system along with continued support for risk reduction. This issue of the journal marks the beginning of the eleventh year of our publication and provides a number of articles related to care and services for people with HIV/AIDS in both the U.S. and international contexts. These articles point to the complexity of living with HIV: what are some important issues to foster both effective coping and positive health outcomes, and how providers may take advantage of these findings in helping clients as well as building systems of services.

Self-reported data through a survey instrument were solicited from all 2912 adults actively enrolled in the Pennsylvania ADAP in 2005. Of the enrollees who responded, 59% reported undetectable viral load, 71% reported CD4 counts of greater than 200 cells/mm3, and 80% reported ease in accessing medical care providers. A positive relationship with clinicians was reported by 93% of respondents, 77% were compliant with treatment, and 87% received timely standard of care. Persons living with HIV/AIDS who were served by Pennsylvania ADAP report higher quality health care, improved health status, improved medication adherence, and lower emergency department/hospital services utilization.

AB- Engaging and retaining persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) in medical care is essential to ensure disease management and successful health outcomes. This article summarizes the results of a qualitative study of 21 staff members from seven programs aimed to engage and retain at-risk PLWHA in HIV medical care. The data revealed five domains of services provided and skills delivered: 1. finding people, 2. delivering services and practical support, 3. assistance with systems navigation and linking to services, 4. providing HIV education and information, and 5. relationship-building. These activities were implemented within a framework of client-centered care and teamwork. These findings can assist program planners and service providers with approaches to enhance staff skills that lead to better quality and service delivery for at-risk PLWHA individuals.

With a community sample of African Americans, Latinos, and White HIV-positive adults receiving services in central Austin, Texas, a binary logistic regression was used to examine the relationship between causal beliefs and predictor variables and multinomial logistic regression analyses were used to examine the relationship between treatment and provider preferences for the symptoms of depression and ethnicity. Differences were found across race/ethnicity with regard to treatment preferences and patterns of causal beliefs were associated with treatment preferences among HIV-positive participants.

AB- The studies presents in this issue Journal of HIV/AIDS & Social Services document information that ethnicity plays an important role in the perceived causes of depression, preferences for particular treatment providers, and depression severity among persons receiving care. These findings are especially important given that micro-level factors such as depression can have many deleterious effects for persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). And investigate challenges experienced by service providers from seven programs providing medical care for PLWHA located in major U.S. cities. The authors focus on four key program dimensions that planners and service providers may strategically employ to bolster engagement and maintenance in medical care, while potentially reducing staff burnout and turnover. Important implications for secondary HIV prevention are given including that sustaining PLWHA in medical care can reduce AIDS mortality and disease transmission. These articles are a powerful reminder to us that we are all linked in the global fight against HIV/AIDS. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- In 1996 when Congress eliminated the federal Aid to Families with Dependent Children program, it was the largest income source of women living with HIV in the United States. In its place, Congress created a new federal block grant, Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF), to fund state-run compulsory workfare programs. To learn how welfare reform affected HIV-positive women, this qualitative narrative analysis examines the experiences of nine seropositive women enrolled in Wisconsin’s TANF program, Wisconsin Works, between 2000 and 2003. Repeated in-depth interviews over 24 months explored participants’ efforts to secure health care, income, and social services. This article analyzes the verbatim transcripts of those in-depth qualitative interviews. Constrained by the double stigma of HIV/AIDS and welfare, with Wisconsin Works Program incomes below half the poverty level, their families lived intermittently on Wisconsin Works income, rent assistance, food assistance, Medicaid, and sometimes child support. Between illness and benefit disruptions, these mostly long-term HIV survivors described feeling exhausted, angry, and demoralized, struggling daily for respect against the system’s bureaucratic disentitlements.

AB- The purpose of this study was to investigate methods to improve support groups for men with HIV/AIDS as barriers have been noted to full utilization. A multimodal study was conducted to accomplish this. Two different survey methods were used: an anonymous survey of 25 potential members and 5 semistructured telephone interviews with a purposive sample of potential members. Three leaders of successful groups for this population were also interviewed via telephone. The facilitators and barriers to group attendance were assessed as well the desired focus for such a group. Results determined that while the majority of respondents wanted a group, educational groups were more desired than support groups and stigma continued to be a barrier to attendance.

AB- Domestic violence shelters (n = 59) in two southwestern states were surveyed about their services related to HIV prevention. Variables included organizational characteristics, agency protocols and practices, HIV/AIDS prevention programming, staffs’ HIV/AIDS knowledge, and staffs’ attitudes regarding HIV/AIDS prevention for women exposed to intimate partner violence. In this exploratory, descriptive study results indicated that most shelters had a significant awareness of how HIV/AIDS is transmitted, but few shelters offered testing (17%) or sexual safety planning (20%). Results also showed that eighty-one percent of respondents believe that HIV/AIDS educational prevention programs could be effective in protecting abused women from contracting HIV/AIDS. However, less than half (46%) of the respondents reported that they disseminate HIV/AIDS information to all women in the shelter.

AB- Over the past few decades, a relationship has emerged between intrapsychic factors and health outcomes in HIV-positive and other populations. We examined whether trait self-enhancement would correlate with immune markers and sexual risk taking in a sample of 54 asymptomatic HIV-positive gay men, most of whom were ethnic minorities. Participants completed a one-time assessment with regard to self-enhancement, psychological distress, and sexual risk taking, and provided consent to access information regarding immune status and other health-related variables. Both self-enhancement and minority status were significantly associated with CD4 counts, but the latter effect disappeared when looking at only white and African American participants. Neither factor was related to viral load, sexual risk taking, or psychological distress. More research with larger and more diverse samples is needed to further elucidate the possible salutary relationship between self-enhancement and critical medical and behavioral outcomes in this population.

AB- Reviews the book, Substance use in patients with HIV/AIDS: HIV clinical guidelines for the primary care practitioner by the AIDS Institute (2009). This book's particular set of guidelines, crafted by a multidisciplinary committee and subject to peer review, are both comprehensive and culturally competent, offering the HIV care practitioner the tools they need to effectively serve those living with HIV who use substances. The book is quite comprehensive, covering a range of essential topics such as screening and assessment, working with active users, treatment modalities, primary care and medical issues, adherence, drug-drug interactions, pain management, alcohol and tobacco use, and special populations. It presents substantial information that can be used by the many nonclinical providers such as case managers, substance abuse counselors, health educators, and outreach workers in the fields of both HIV and substance use disorder. The only potential barrier to use of this book for these nonclinicians may be the presence of significant medical jargon in various chapters. This book focuses not only on clinical issues but also on a broader psychosocial spectrum that may affect patient health and well-being. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)

In addition, three nurses, two physicians, and five reproductive health accredited social health activists (ASHAs) took part in focus groups. The WLA offered insight into the benefits of HIV-trained ASHAs including emotional support, assistance with travel to health care providers and antiretroviral therapy medication adherence. Health care providers also identified benefits of using HIV-trained ASHAs and suggested modalities for how to train these individuals. These findings will contribute to the design of a future program of care involving HIV-trained ASHAs. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- School-based programs have been found to be effective in limiting sexual risk behaviors among adolescents. A peer-led educational program is one of the school-based approaches used to educate and empower adolescents toward healthy behaviors. The purposes of this study were to determine the effectiveness of a peer education program on improving adolescents’ HIV/AIDS knowledge and self-efficacy for limiting sexual risk behaviors and also to determine the influence of self-efficacy on adolescents’ HIV knowledge. A quasi-experimental design was used to evaluate the peer education program. The results of the study demonstrated that HIV knowledge and self-efficacy improved significantly post-intervention. Since children spend a considerable time in school, more school-based programs need to be developed to promote information on risk behaviors and prevention.

AB- Over 1,500 rural and urban providers in Alaska and New Mexico responded to our survey assessing their perceptions of stigma associated with HIV/AIDS. Findings indicated that providers perceive HIV/AIDS as highly stigmatized and stigmatized more than other physical and mental illnesses. Perceptions of HIV/AIDS stigma varied across community sizes, with highest levels in rural communities and lower levels in urban, small urban, and small rural communities. Across communities, behavioral health care providers reported perceptions of greater stigma associated with HIV, AIDS, and other illnesses than did physical health care providers. Increased stigma in rural communities exacerbates health care disparities faced by rural residents and underscores the need for research on reducing stigma associated with HIV/AIDS.

AB- Burnout has been identified as a significant factor in HIV/AIDS volunteering. It has been associated with depression, anxiety, and the loss of volunteers from the health care delivery system. The aim of this study was to test the independence of the health and motivational processes hypothesized within the Job Demands-Resources model of burnout in HIV/AIDS volunteers. Participants were 307 HIV/AIDS volunteers from state AIDS Councils throughout Australia who completed self-report measures pertaining to role ambiguity and role conflict, social support, burnout, intrinsic and organizational satisfaction, and depression. Findings suggested that the independence of the dual processes hypothesized by the model was only partially supported. These findings provide a model for burnout that gives a framework for interventions at both the individual and organizational levels, which would contribute to the prevention of burnout, depression, and job dissatisfaction in HIV/AIDS volunteers.

AB- On January 13, 2010, the first case of discrimination against an HIV-positive child by a camp was settled. This case illustrates the issue of discrimination against people living with HIV and the need for renewed diligence in the fight for the rights of those who are oppressed. Today, almost 30 years after the first documented case of HIV, we continue to witness the discrimination against and the oppression of people living with HIV/AIDS. There are people who still fear contracting the disease in ways that are not transmittable. As a result of these fears, feelings sometime turn to anger and discrimination occurs. Discrimination continues to take place in many different areas of society, including violations of basic civil rights against people with HIV/AIDS. As people are living longer with HIV, issues that have not come up previously are now becoming evident. Although the number of HIV-positive babies being born has decreased significantly, the rate of discrimination will continue to be high as long as people remain ignorant of the rights of people living with the disease. It is certainly incumbent upon people who deal with and are responsible for the welfare of our children to be well informed on these issues. Social workers need to be vigilante in ensuring that providers are aware of their responsibilities and that HIV-infected individuals are aware of their rights.

AB- In nearly three decades after the advent of HIV/AIDS disease, its demands on physical, emotional, social, spiritual, financial, and organizational resources are profound. This journal edition reports the findings from four studies that encompass major variables in the stress process: two studies are targeted to clients and potential clients and two center on programmatic concerns and service providers. The authors in this edition of the journal apply components of the stress process and share with our readership some fascinating findings on stress reduction. In addition to these four articles, this edition of the journal includes two other formats: an editorial and a book review. The findings and recommendations for the multiple approaches to reduce stress, stigma, and discrimination within this edition will stimulate discussion, creative programming, and further research.

AB- As the AIDS/HIV epidemic grows exponentially in Tanzania, the number of children who are orphaned due to this illness has increased in alarming proportions. Utilizing a preliminary exploration of a case study, this article explores a unique, collaborative, grassroots model of comprehensive community care. Orphans International Tanzania (OIT) operates a unique family preservation and support program, the Family Care Program, which aims to maintain orphaned children in home environments with access to education, basic medical care, and good nutrition. Incorporating a strategic international agency/community-based nongovernment organization partnership design and an internationally recognized family support model, comprehensive services are provided to children and their caregivers. This article provides information on impact of HIV/AIDS on Tanzania, illustrates the components of the program model, highlights critical community partnership development, and describes its influence on the children, their kinship caregivers and the community in general. Implications for replication in other communities impacted by HIV/AIDS are provided. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

It outlines the causes of HIV transmission, the development of community initiatives to provide services and education programs to underserved families and orphans affected by the disease, and activities of multinational organizations as they partner with FBOs to strengthen education programs, provide for orphans, deliver services, and develop community relationships. The paper suggests strategies for strengthening partnerships, identifies problems that affect the implementation of strategies, and makes recommendations for developing sustainable community relationships.

AB- There is a growing literature on African sexuality that established the presence of homosexuality in about 50 African societies, although widespread public and religious discourse claims homosexuality does not occur in Africa. This article draws from 24 in-depth interviews and one focus group discussion with men who have sex with men (MSM) in Addis Ababa, within a societal context where homosexuality is illegal. The results revealed that there is some degree of misinformation among the MSM who believe that HIV/AIDS can only be transmitted through heterosexual sex. Thus, MSM seemed to be vulnerable to HIV/AIDS and other STIs because of unprotected anal sex, which they believed to be safe. The findings highlight that current efforts aimed at preventing the spread of HIV are not reaching some high-risk behaviors. These findings suggest that interventions aimed at preventing the spread of HIV could benefit from addressing different types of sexual practices and identities. Otherwise, a significant unacknowledged transmission route of HIV may hamper all other public health campaigns against HIV transmission in Ethiopia and make the cost of such campaigns needlessly wasteful.

This article documents the experiences of 17 people living with HIV/AIDS, based on their in-depth interviews by the author. The use of holy water is considered by them to be an alternative and complementary treatment for HIV/AIDS. In addition, there are some other spiritual practices that can be considered spiritual treatment. The issue of using antiretroviral treatment together with holy water treatment remains controversial among the research participants. The article shows areas of intervention for social workers regarding the people living with HIV/AIDS who are heading to holy water sites for relief.

AB- The Journal of HIV/AIDS & Social Services is pleased to present the first special issue focusing exclusively on countries in eastern Africa. This issue presents research on populations in Ethiopia, Tanzania, and Zambia, which reflect some of the innovative research and practice activities that social workers are undertaking in these areas. In many ways, this volume reflects the profession's international vision of social work, having the goal of assessing and conceptualizing the strengths and challenges experienced by the people in these countries, especially as it relates to HIV disease. This special issue, in part, is the byproduct of a series of strategic collaborations. An impetus for the call for papers came from the editors who participate in the Social Work Education in Ethiopia Partnership (SWEEP). This issue of the Journal of HIV/AIDS & Social Services primarily illuminates the work of some HIV practitioners and researchers within these countries, some of whom are affiliated with these educational partnerships, as well as several additional articles.

AB- Young men who have sex with men are disproportionately affected by HIV/AIDS, yet relatively little is known about the most effective theoretical frameworks for preventive interventions with this population. This study investigated the fit of the Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills (IMB) model for predicting sexual risk among a sample of ethnically diverse young men who have sex with men aged 14 to 21. Path analysis results indicated that the IMB model predicted a moderate amount of variance in primary and secondary sexual risk for young men who have sex with men (r² = .26 and .21, respectively). Fit of this model was acceptable on most indicators of model fit for primary and secondary risk. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- In Tanzania, about 7% of the adult population is HIV-infected. Given limited pharmaceutical options, adherence to strategies that foster health and well-being is vital to reducing both new and repeated HIV exposure. We investigated the influences of HIV/AIDS-related stress and social support on adherence to health promotion strategies by people living with HIV/AIDS in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. In-person interviews were conducted with 212 individuals who were clients of local AIDS service organizations. Regression analyses indicated that HIV-associated stress had a direct, negative effect on adherence, decreasing the practice of health-maintaining behaviors and increasing engagement in sexual risk behaviors. Informal social support moderated the relationship between stress and sexual risk but did not buffer the impact of stress on health-enhancing behaviors. No moderation effect was found for formal social support. The implications of our findings for social work and public health practice are discussed.

AB- The 2007 World Bank data on HIV/AIDS for sub-Saharan Africa indicates that 22.5 million adults and children over 15 are living with HIV, including 1.7 million new infections. AIDS killed approximately 2.3 million people in the same year, making this region by far the worst affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic. This paper proposes a macro-level model for understanding the spread of disease within the context of migration. We use social capital theory to generate a framework for exploring how migration might serve as a conduit for the disease transmission. Specifically, we investigated male migrants in the Republic of Angola and argued that a migrant laborer’s movement away from his village diminishes his social capital in terms of social support, norms, and networks while stresses from migration could prove to be conducive to the spread of the HIV virus. We use univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses to explore the relationship between migration and HIV risk while considering social capital as the intervening factor. Social capital is conceptualized as a combination of social engagement, social support, and person-to-person contact. To this end, this study analyzes secondary data collected on a sample of migrants in Angola. Two hypotheses are tested: Migrants have lower social capital than nonmigrants and lower levels of social capital are related to higher risky behaviors. Results indicate that migrants have a lower level of social capital and migrants with lower social capital tended to have higher risky behavior.

AB- A process model guided a qualitative study of a 10-week multifamily conflict management intervention, Family Pride. A central construct is interpersonal concordance, defined as the consensus within a family on their views of self and one another. Parent/caregivers and children described themselves and each other near the beginning and at the conclusion of this intervention. Hierarchical classes analysis (HICLAS) facilitated measurement of interpersonal concordance. A focused investigation of one family demonstrated a shift in their perceptions toward greater interpersonal concordance. Further analyses revealed a general shift toward more cooperative views of self and other family members, and toward greater interpersonal concordance.

AB- This study identified the psychosocial stressors of low-income families who were affected by HIV/AIDS in Alabama. Methods consisted of personal interviews with 12 social workers at public agencies and a review of social work charts for 80 clients at an HIV clinic for mothers and children. The combined results indicated that families were likely to experience housing instability, family breakdown, mental illness, behavioral problems, and stigma. Younger children typically lived with their mothers, while older biological children often resided with relatives or in foster care. Social workers perceived mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety to be common among women caregivers. Behavioral problems and learning difficulties were frequently reported among children but children who were not living with HIV/AIDS did not have the same access to health care and social services as their siblings who were living with HIV/AIDS. This outcome is relevant to social workers because the children who were affected by HIV/AIDS outnumbered the children who were living with HIV/AIDS by a ratio of 3 to 1. Findings suggest that a model of care that involves funding for family-centered services for caregivers and children would provide a useful foundation for building stronger, more resilient families.

AB- This paper describes a successful HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment project that combined medical, support, and educational services, thereby improving care in a rural American Indian tribe in the southwestern United States. Using the methods of community-based participatory evaluation and motivational interviewing, the 5-year, multiparty collaborative project improved health care access and medical regimen adherence of people with HIV/AIDS and increased the risk - and protective-factor knowledge of tribal members at high risk for the disease. The success of the collaborative in achieving all these goals highlights the importance of tribal control, collaboration, and incorporation of tradition and culture in HIV/AIDS diagnostic, treatment, and prevention efforts.

AB- Literature on HIV-related stigma suggests that high levels of stigma are associated with poor medical adherence, depression, and decreased self-esteem. More recent research has focused on the acts of HIV-related discrimination experienced by infected individuals. However, little literature has explored the connection between perceptions of HIV-related stigma, discrimination, and knowledge of legal rights. Thirty-seven HIV-positive adults were surveyed regarding their experiences with HIV-related stigma and discrimination. Participants’ knowledge of legal rights concerning HIV-related discrimination was also assessed. Personalized stigma was significantly correlated with reports of discrimination. Thirty-three percent of participants reported they had lost a job, and 25% reported they had to move because of their HIV status. Overall, the majority of participants were relatively informed about the legal rights of HIV-infected individuals. However, 21% believed that a restaurant could refuse to serve a person with HIV. Further analyses revealed that those participants who had high knowledge of legal rights scored significantly lower on the disclosure concerns subscale of the stigma scale and total number of acts of discrimination. Findings indicate the need for education concerning legal rights and that HIV-related stigma and discrimination are still a concern for infected individuals.

AB- This study’s primary aim was to provide co-occurring mental and substance use disorders (COD) prevalence data as well as additional epidemiologic data needed to more firmly establish violence exposure and COD as principally associated with HIV infection. Participants were clients assessed for alcohol and other drug treatment through the network of providers overseen by the Alcohol and Drug Addiction Services Board of Cuyahoga County (Ohio) from December 12, 2001 through July 18, 2007. Study design was a matched comparison of two groups of equal number (N = 638): HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected clients. The prevalence of COD with HIV infection was determined to be 26.3%. Through logistic regression modeling, both violence exposure and COD were found to be associated with HIV infection. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Motivational interviewing (MI) and stages of change are clinical and theoretical techniques receiving considerable attention in the alcohol and other drug treatment arena. An attempt was made to evaluate whether the theoretical perspectives behind MI and the transtheoretical stages of change model would increase treatment retention and completion with persons who are both alcohol and other drug dependent and HIV infected. A post-test design was used to test the potential of MI to increase the number of days in treatment and completion rates. Results showed that utilizing MI and the stages of change model did not increase the number of days in treatment, nor was there an increase in treatment completion. Findings suggest that those with multiple problems requiring an array of change stages to monitor may not benefit from this model.

AB- The increased mortality among persons co-infected with HIV/AIDS and hepatitis C (HCV) is a concern that provider training on HCV-HIV co-infection may address. Medical and behavioral health providers were given training on co-infection. This study addresses two research questions: What changes, if any, did providers seek to effect in their practice after training? Of those providers desiring change in their practice, which, if any, did they implement? Surveys indicated that 82% planned to change their practice. Of those, 51% were reached 3 months later, and of those, 86% reported having enacted a change. Qualitative analysis found that planned changes fell into two domains: HCV Education and HCV Medical Actions. The most frequently intended and enacted changes involved patient education. Barriers to enact changes included lack of colleague support for HCV treatment and inadequate access to hepatitis A/B vaccine. Training on HIV-HCV co-infection should: engage multiple providers from the same site; address HCV treatment side effects; and support systems changes targeting vaccine and testing availability.

AB- Within the Veterans Health Administration, substance use disorder clinics can be important locations for identifying HIV-infected patients. In this formative evaluation we assessed organizational readiness to implement a nurse-initiated HIV rapid test strategy in two Veterans Health Administration substance use disorder clinics. We conducted 34 quantitative surveys and 21 key informant interviews with front-line staff and management to assess attitudes regarding HIV testing in general and nurse-initiated HIV rapid testing specifically. We also assessed potential organizational impediments and facilitators to the implementation of nurse-initiated HIV rapid testing. Staff agreed that nurse-initiated HIV rapid testing is supported by research evidence, clinical experience, and patient need. Staff differed on the degree to which nurse-initiated HIV rapid test strategy fit within the substance use disorder clinic mission. We identified barriers to the implementation of nurse-initiated HIV rapid testing, including resource limitations, concerns of organizational readiness and patient acceptance of the nurse-initiated HIV rapid testing strategy. Despite these hurdles, the clinics are willing to adopt nurse-initiated HIV rapid testing if supported by appropriate modifications in organizational structure, HIV ordering policies, and specific changes in clinical practices.

AB- Peer and health educators often facilitate interventions to increase safer sexual behavior among people living with HIV/AIDS. Absent from much of the HIV/AIDS prevention literature, however, is the impact of facilitation on interventionists and their needs while delivering safer sex interventions. These issues are particularly salient for peer interventionists who often share the HIV status and life challenges of intervention participants. In this article we present the clinical supervision strategy that we used, in which a social worker trained and supported peers and a health educator who delivered a safer sex intervention for HIV-positive women, as a case study with implications for future research and practice, to (1) identify the training, supervision, and emotional support needs of peers and health educators; (2) highlight the important role of clinical supervision in HIV prevention programming; and (3) share and promote the replication and testing of successful clinical supervision strategies.

AB- Early in the epidemic, HIV infection and AIDS were rarely diagnosed in women. Today, the HIV/AIDS epidemic represents a growing and persistent health threat to women, especially young women. The purpose of the current study was to conduct an international study with female undergraduate college students to assess knowledge and attitudes about HIV/AIDS, current and future sexual behaviors, and condom use self-efficacy. Participants included several convenience samples of female undergraduate college students from three public universities in the southern region of the United States (n = 112), a large public university in Australia (n = 66), and a public university in Hong Kong (n = 93). This research study utilizes a quantitative survey research design. Seventy-seven percent of American women and 66% of Australian women were sexually active compared with only 21% of Chinese women (χ² = 67.74, p &lt; .001). Of the sexually active women, 86% of Australian women reported regular use of safer sex practices during the past year compared with 69% of American women and 20% of Chinese women (χ² = 8.9, p &lt; .05). Although the sample as a whole scored generally high on HIV/AIDS awareness, it is not reflected in safe sex practices or intentions for future safe sex practices. Future studies should focus on further understanding the social, cultural, and psychological factors that hamper safe sex practices among this population as well as successful intervention strategies to overcome these barriers.

AB- Youths in foster care face challenges, including making healthy behavioral choices. Empirical data from a sample show how intentions to engage in HIV-risk behaviors vary among youths in foster care. Youths who hold safer attitudes about prevention and those who have fewer peers with behavioral problems more often intend safer behavior. Among young women, a stronger orientation toward the future is associated with fewer behavioral intentions that involve HIV risk. Youths in foster care who are in higher grades, express greater self-efficacy, or have fewer problems with mental health or substance abuse express a stronger and more hopeful orientation toward the future. These research results support the application of integrated health behavior theory among youths in foster care, showing that preventive attitudes, well-behaved peers, and a stronger orientation toward the future are associated with fewer behavioral intentions that precede HIV risk.

AB- Most new HIV infections among African American women are due to unprotected sex in heterosexual relationships. Women's scores on measures of relationship power and unmitigated communion (focus on others and exclusion of self) are associated with risky sexual behavior. We hypothesized African American women scoring low on relationship power and high on unmitigated communion would report greater risk for HIV infection. In a sample of 217 African American adult women, relationship power strongly correlated with HIV risk (p &lt; .05), but unmitigated communion did not. Relationship power explained 40% of the variance in women's perceived HIV risk (β = -.631, p = .000). Compared to their high relationship power counterparts, African American women with low to moderate levels of relationship power were 5 to 40 times less likely to successfully negotiate condom use and only reduced their HIV risk by 5% to 20% (compared to 80% to 95% improvements in risk reduction by their high relationship power counterparts).

AB- A safe and efficacious HIV vaccine would be a tremendous asset to halting the spread of HIV. Nevertheless, HIV vaccines face a range of social and behavioral challenges that will determine their ultimate contribution to prevention. HIV vaccine development and clinical trials raise thorny social, behavioral, and ethical issues around resource allocation, recruitment and enrollment, trial implementation, and post-trial follow-up and access to services. Furthermore, the success of future HIV vaccines is contingent on access and acceptability. Involvement of social work and social service providers and engagement of social science research across the continuum of HIV vaccine development and dissemination are central to successful community engagement and advocacy, mitigation of social harms of clinical trials, support for fair and ethical conduct of trials, acceptability and access to future vaccines, and integration of HIV vaccines with behavioral HIV prevention.

AB- African American adolescent females continue to be at disproportionate high risk for HIV infection. A repeated measures quasi-experimental comparison group design compared an HIV risk-reduction intervention delivered by mothers with an HIV risk-reduction intervention delivered by health professionals and with a health promotion intervention delivered by mothers. The three interventions were randomly assigned to one of three geographical distinct sites. A convenience sample of 553 low-income African American adolescent girls with a baseline age of 11 to 14 years participated in the study. The results revealed that over a 6-month period, compared to girls in the health promotion intervention, the girls in the HIV risk-reduction interventions had significant higher scores on HIV transmission knowledge, condom attitudes, and self-efficacy to use condoms. The implication is mothers who receive appropriate training may be able to deliver HIV risk reduction to their daughters as well as health professionals.

AB- Custody planning programs for HIV-infected parents help families overcome the obstacles to making future plans for their children in the event of the parent’s debilitating illness or death. Using the family resiliency model, custody planning is viewed as a form of adaptation to illness which can reduce stress and uncertainty for children and parents. Case studies of four parents’ participation in a custody planning program illustrate patterns that can inform service provision, including the role of social services in facilitating that process, while recognizing the uniqueness of each family’s experience. As people with HIV are living longer, service needs have shifted to developing and maintaining family adaptation and stability, with custody planning as one component. Service providers with HIV-affected families must recognize the impact of low socioeconomic status on service access and use, with sensitivity to stigma, substance abuse, and mental health.

AB- The purpose of this study was to examine risk factors, knowledge, and attitudes as predictors of intent to use condoms among 290 minority female adolescents who attended family planning clinics. Data on demographic characteristics and risk behaviors such as drug use, school attendance, and contraceptive use were gathered. The results indicated that slightly over half of the teens intended to use condoms at the next intercourse. Overall knowledge about HIV/AIDS and STDs was poor and was not a predictor of intent to use condoms. Teens who intended to use condoms had more favorable attitudes about condom use and a better sense of self-protection regardless of partner feelings or beliefs. These findings suggest that program planners need to be aware that inconsistencies between knowledge and the behaviors of teens exist and this must be viewed within the teens’ cultural milieu. Condom use and sex education should become a collaborative endeavor among teens, parents, and partners of female adolescents.

AB- This exploratory study investigated the relationship between specific dimensions of spirituality and various HIV-related risk factors. A convenience sample of 95 young Black college students participated in the study. Primary measures assessed whether spirituality (i.e., prayer, a positive world view, and belief in the spirit world) was related to HIV self-efficacy and HIV-related risk factors (i.e., attitudes toward safer sex, peer norms endorsing safer sex, perceived susceptibility to HIV, substance use, intention to practice safer sex, and an expectation to practice safer sex). Regression findings indicated that higher levels of prayer were associated with greater HIV self-efficacy and a decreased perception of being at risk for contracting HIV. In addition, a positive world view was associated with greater peer norms endorsing safer sex. Findings indicated a direct relationship between specific components of spirituality and various HIV-related domains. Implications for social work research and practice are discussed in the context of these findings. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- HIV is not only a public health crisis, an economic crisis, and a social crisis; it is a human rights crisis. Yet in the United States, HIV has not been approached through a human rights perspective. In general, people with HIV or at risk for HIV have been treated as distrusted perpetrators, and access to needed services, information, and care have been selectively, not universally, available. Because the United States is globally influential in HIV funding and policies, our neglect and abuse of human rights have been exported. This paper uses the human rights lens to examine some of the ways in which the United States has traditionally approached the HIV pandemic and to critique those approaches, and suggests what HIV policy might be if universal human rights were considered.

AB- Despite other investigations into the impact on the quality of life (QoL) of people living with HIV, the effects of HIV/AIDS case management services have not been directly investigated in the professional literature. A small HIV/AIDS case management program conducted an analysis of the services provided over a 6-month period with preassessments and postassessments of client QoL. A convenience sample of 78 clients completed the Multidimensional Quality of Life questionnaire for people with HIV. Demographics and QoL scores show expected relationships, such as higher QoL scores among clients with higher income, which are consistent with prior research. The study found significant relationships between elements of case management and specific domains of client QoL. Direct case manager interventions, such as counseling clients about coping with depression, had the strongest relationship with client QoL.

AB- This paper explores the beliefs and behaviors surrounding substance use and HIV risk among a convenience sample of 98 men who have sex with men (MSM) in a mid-sized community located in the central United States. Several interesting patterns were identified in the descriptive analyses. Multivariate analysis identified two variables—belief that recreational drug use made sexual experiences better and reports that most MSM friends drank alcohol or took recreational drugs—that were significant predictors of engagement in substance using behavior. Models accounted for 24% of the variance in drinking behavior and 15% of the variance in drug using behavior. Suggestions for HIV/AIDS prevention and intervention and implications for future research are given. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Many HIV-infected individuals experience varying degrees of stigma on the basis of multiple aspects of their identity. Cultural competence for this population must address all of the ways that clients experience stigma, including not only race and ethnicity but also gender, economic status, sexual orientation, geography, drug use, and physical health status. This article reports on an evaluation study of a mental health program for people living with HIV/AIDS. Findings suggest that social service agencies need to be responsive to all aspects of a client's identity. Implications for practice with this multidimensional population are also discussed.

AB- This community-based exploratory study examined the effects of a history of violence, ethnic identification, and acculturation status on HIV risk among a majority Latino sample of youth living in a large metropolitan area of the Southwest in the United States. The participants reported high rates of violence and attitudes that put them at risk for HIV/AIDS infection. They participated in one of two prevention interventions offered by a local non-governmental organization. The first intervention was tailored for adjudicated youth (N = 49) who were either institutionalized or returning to the community after involvement with the criminal justice system. The second intervention targeted youth (N = 32) who were homeless/runaway and/or self-identified as gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender (GLBT). T-tests and linear regression were used to determine the differences between youth reporting a history of violence by type of perpetrator, its relationship with HIV risk, and the role of ethnic identification and acculturation status as potential protective factors. Violence by a family member was the most common type of violence reported, with a history of violence positively related to HIV risk. Ethnic identification and linguistic acculturation had a protective effect against HIV risk among the homeless and GLBT youth but not among the adjudicated youth.

AB- Reviews the book, Community interventions and AIDS edited by Trickett E. J. and Pequegnat W. (see record [rid]2006-00528-000[/rid]). As the AIDS epidemic continues to rage into a third decade, the pervasive challenge of effectively preventing and intervening with this disease on micro and macro levels also continues. Although this book does not propose any new solutions to the epidemic, it does provide a comprehensive examination of the difficulties, failures, and successes of preventing the transmission of HIV in diverse populations. This book provides a very well-integrated review of the state of community prevention interventions for HIV. Although the problems inherent in community interventions are detailed, no single, long-term solution emerges from this book. The authors of this book should be commended on at least tackling an incredibly multifaceted, multicultural problem that changes with societal opinions, institutional and cultural mores, emerging treatment options, the implementation of new laws and policies, and so forth. Unfortunately, other areas of prevention and intervention were lacking in the book. The book might be too informational and difficult to digest for the casual or lay reader because of the highly technical, scientific writing that is used throughout. However, for those interested in this topic, this book will be a standard text for years to come. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Public health departments, correctional institutions, and community-based organizations (CBOs) are increasingly working together to improve and support the health of inmates returning to the community, especially those with HIV. CBOs, and particularly the staff of CBOs, are key in providing HIV services to transitioning inmates; however, little data are available to characterize these staff. The purpose of this qualitative assessment is to describe the experiences and motivations of frontline staff involved in HIV related service delivery to inmates and ex-offenders participating in the CDC/HRSA Corrections Demonstration Project. Eight focus groups with a total of 64 participants were held during a National CBO Meeting with frontline staff. Content analysis focused on staff experiences, motivations, and definitions of client success. Staff draw on personal, educational, and professional experiences to do their jobs, and they are motivated by a desire to help clients. Individuals in social work with similar experiences may find a unique niche working with this population. In fact, individuals with a heightened sensitivity for inmates and ex-offenders may consider the fields of social work, nursing, counseling, community psychology, or public health to enhance their training and better serve this population. Additional findings emphasize the importance of acknowledging the small steps along the continuum of client success. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- An adherence-focused case management intervention was evaluated in 84 public clinic patients in Los Angeles County, California, and included weekly contact with a paraprofessional case manager development of an individualized highly-active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) adherence support plan, and referrals to ancillary services. Participants were primarily Latino (65%) or African American (25%); male (74%); monolingual Spanish-speakers (57%) with annual incomes under $10,000 (65%). Participants were in the intervention for a median of 26 weeks; attended 67% of appointments; participated in an average of 9 hours of case management; and each visit averaged 23 minutes. Seventy-two percent of the goals established at baseline were achieved and 74% of referrals were completed. The most common goals were related to adherence (16%), housing (12%), or nutrition (12%). Self-reported adherence to HAART was no different for intervention participants compared to those in standard case management at 6 months. These data suggest that an adherence-focused case management program was effective in achieving established goals and referrals. In addition, the existing provider and standard case management adherence support appears sufficient to sustain adherence in this public clinic population.

AB- Corazón de Aztlan is a comprehensive and culturally competent adolescent development program for Mexican American and other Hispanic youth intended to prevent risky sexual behavior. Perceptions of Corazón de Aztlan participants on condom use and their implications are presented. Evaluation of HIV/AIDS prevention program effects indicated the program increased accurate knowledge of safer sexual behavior, understanding of peer pressure, negotiation skills involved in having safer sex, sense of vulnerability to HIV/AIDS, and abstinence from sexual activity, but not safer sex among those already sexually active. Contrasting rational decision-making and judgment theoretical models for understanding adolescent high-risk sexual behavior demonstrates the necessity of developing stronger partnerships between families, schools, and the larger community that could be instrumental in the creation of environments that would be more protective of youth. The potential benefits of using peer educator models and culturally competent sex education methods are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- This qualitative rapid ethnographic study identifies, describes and classifies the impact of socio structural domains and their factors on men who have sex with men (MSM) HIV transmission risk. Included are the perceptions of HIV risk by four MSM subgroups: HIV positive, Latino, black, and young (aged 18 to 24). Results classify participant-perceived MSM transmission factors into socio structural domains (e.g., social, health, economic, political, and mental health). Included in the article is a discussion of domain factors perceived as suitable for systemic intervention including addressing social stigma and discrimination, promoting MSM health and sexual health, and preventing and treating substance use. A review of study limitations and recommendations for future research conclude this article. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Engagement and retention in treatment are important keys to adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for people living with HIV/AIDS. Engaging with HIV-positive substance abusers is particularly challenging because of their multiple needs. Although co-locating primary care, substance abuse, mental health, and support services are thought to be most effective for treatment, such programs can be difficult to implement. Collaboration and linkage between community service providers offer a good alternative method for reaching service integration. This article overviews the treatment integration needs of HIV-positive substance abusers and describes how one empirically selected social service program originated and continues to assist a community-based approach to care.

AB- HIV carries a significant social stigma, and people who are HIV positive and people who love and work with them may experience HIV-related stigma. The effects and magnitude of HIV-related stigma and stigmatizing behaviors are diverse. This qualitative study explored felt HIV-related stigma among adults with HIV including individual experiences and insight into the mechanism of HIV-related stigma. Participants shared experiences, and how they managed, coped and survived. Grounded theory analysis revealed that at the core of facing and managing stigma was living with HIV. Components of resilience—risk factors, protective factors and coping skills—were illustrated, and implicate further research.

AB- This study examined the relationships of demographic and psychosocial variables to disclosure of HIV infection. HIV-positive adults (n = 156) completed measures assessing depression, perceived satisfaction with social support, and attitudes related to disclosure among their social network. Nearly everyone in this sample (98%) disclosed HIV status to at least one person. Greater depressive symptoms were reported among participants who experienced regret after disclosure. Moreover, the decision never to disclose was associated with less social support satisfaction. These findings suggest that interventions that develop effective serostatus disclosure skills may be efficacious in decreasing psychosocial distress among HIV-positive adults.

AB- Several health related quality of life (HRQOL) instruments have been developed and used in HIV/AIDS research. Selecting an accurate instrument to evaluate how the HRQOL of persons living with HIV/AIDS evolve under care is essential. Accuracy is estimated with statistical methods that determine how HRQOL instruments perform internally and when compared to other measures. We review here the accuracy of measures used in fourteen HIV/AIDS HRQOL instruments. Some dimensions of accuracy have been measured in each of the instruments including construct validity, criterion validity, internal consistency reliability, sensitivity to change, and test-retest reliability, although none of these were evaluated using all measures of accuracy. There is a need for standardization of the statistical methods used to validate HRQOL in HIV/AIDS questionnaires and for an agreement on a standard instrument.

Highlighting the needs for research and intervention identified by Caribbean social workers, educators, health care providers, and government officials, we suggest ways social workers both in the Caribbean and abroad can contribute to exploring the co-morbidity of alcohol use and risk for sexual HIV transmission. Data addressing the potential link between alcohol use and risky sexual behaviors are urgently needed to inform prevention and intervention policies and programs at the national and regional level.

AB- Women living with HIV often feel isolated. One significant avenue for HIV-positive women to receive the support, information, and affiliation they need is through gender-specific HIV support groups, but research is lacking about how support groups for HIV-positive women can be helpful. This exploratory study examined HIV-positive women’s perceptions about their experiences in women-only HIV support groups. Seventy-one women attending nine women-only HIV support groups in Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina were surveyed. Benefits from attendance included: (a) increase in medication compliance, (b) decreased risk behavior for re-exposure to HIV, (c) reduced feelings of shame, and (d) a network of friends to socialize with. Results indicate that even if women-only HIV support groups do not stress behavior or lifestyle changes, these are often by-products of support group attendance.

AB- Interventions for people with HIV/AIDS became a national priority in 2003. While the importance of involving HIV-positive people in the design, delivery, and evaluation of prevention programs is widely recognized, information about how to implement peer-based services in clinic settings is sparse. The four projects described in this article implemented peer-based interventions as part of larger, multi-site Special Projects of National Significance (SPNS) initiative. Common themes reported by Project Directors/Evaluators describe the challenges and benefits of peer-based interventions across these programs, including infrastructural, clinical and research-related issues. We also discuss the benefits to Peers, researchers, and the clinics sites. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

This issue addresses a number of topics rather than addressing any specific theme. One of the article in the issue reports on four federally funded initiatives, some individual and some group based, capitalizing on informal relationships, sharing experience and addressing prevention by involving people living with HIV. This issue closes with three book reviews. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- This paper analyzed the factors that influence farmers’ involvement in some risky HIV=AIDS prone behaviors in the southern part of Nigeria. The data were collected in 2004 from 515 farmers in 5 randomly selected states. Using the Probit regression analysis, it was found that male farmers and those from South-East/South-South have significantly lower probability of involvement in risky behaviors (p &lt; .05). Risk behaviors were associated with lower ages, poverty, higher education, lack of knowledge about HIV prevention, general HIV information, and reported cases of the disease in the village (p &lt; .05). Findings indicate addressing HIV/AIDS in rural areas is paramount for socioeconomic development, and farmers must be educated on appropriate protective methods in order to reduce the rate of infection.

AB- The need for HIV/AIDS social services continues to grow; workers confront increasingly complex client needs, and changes to government funding policies present new challenges to frontline social workers. Drawing on a qualitative study involving 59 social service practitioners in Ontario, Canada, this paper explores how frontline workers experience policy changes that restrict government funding. Respondents report that many of their clients are focused on immediate needs, such as food or shelter, rather than their HIV infection. They describe how funding cuts can introduce uncertainty into their work, and they note that their work now feels more bureaucratic and less caring. More organizational work is required to access resources and workers often find themselves playing a gate-keeping role. The paper describes how workers try to minimize the negative policy changes they perceive, but some of their ways of managing increased demand can actually end up increasing barriers to clients. Findings suggest that changing policies can undermine efforts to involve people with HIV in service delivery and to advocate for changing the social context of the epidemic.

AB- Qualitative methods aid in classifying and assessing cultural and environmental factors and their effect on HIV transmission risk behavior among men who have sex with men (MSM). The present study includes the perspectives of four MSM subgroups (HIV positive MSM, Latino MSM, Black MSM, and MSM between ages 18 and 24) obtained through ethnographic interviews, focus groups, and a sociodemographic survey. Study findings based upon a cross-case analysis of these interviews point to cultural norms such as limited sexual negotiation and substance use as influencing MSM HIV transmission risk. In addition, MSM environments for seeking sexual partners (gay bars, bathhouses, the Internet) contribute to risk in setting-specific ways. The rich information provided by the MSM point to suitable recommendations for systemic intervention including increasing substance use prevention efforts among MSM, development of interpersonal and sexual negotiation skills, chiefly among young MSM, and the importance of MSM environments for improving HIV prevention.

AB- Shared needle and syringe use among injection drug users continues to be a major mode of transmission of HIV. Needle and syringe exchange (NSE) may be a viable strategy to reduce the transmission of the virus; yet the difficulty in measuring the actual efficacy of NSE has limited attempts to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the intervention. Using data specific to the Lower East Side Harm Reduction Center in New York City, we assessed the cost-effectiveness of NSE over a range of conservative estimates of efficacy, obtained from both longitudinal and small-area studies. A decision-analysis model was created to compare the outcomes and costs associated with NSE. Model inputs included the cost of living with HIV and the seroprevalence of HIV among injection drug users in New York City. This analysis was conducted from both the government and societal perspectives. Tested over a range of conservative parameter estimates, NSE appears to save money and lives. The NSE program we evaluated cost $502 per client and produced a gain of 0.01 quality adjusted life years per client. It also reduced HIV treatment costs by $325,000 per case of HIV averted, and averted 4–7 HIV infections per 1000 clients, producing a net cost savings.

AB- Purpose: Adults over 50 years of age constitute 11% of new AIDS cases reported (CDC, 2007). In addition to consistent rates of infection among older adults, there is a disproportionate impact of HIV/AIDS on ethnic minority older adults. Despite the steady rise and projections of increase, there is still a paucity of education and prevention programs targeting this population. This article addresses these demographic trends by reporting on findings about HIV/AIDS AIDS knowledge, attitudes toward sexuality, risk behaviors, and participation in HIV/AIDS education programs from an ethnically diverse sample of adults 50 years and older. Design and Methods: A purposive sample (N = 249) of ethnically and economically diverse adults 50 years and older were selected from 14 organizations in rural and urban settings in California. They were surveyed to determine their HIV/AIDS knowledge, attitudes toward sexuality, high-risk behaviors, and interest in participating in HIV/AIDS education prevention programs. Results: (a) ethnic minority group participants had lower levels of knowledge; (b) over 50% of the sample believed that they do not have to be concerned about HIV/AIDS infection; and (c) participants who self-identified as Hispanic were overrepresented in the group that is likely or very likely to attend HIV/AIDS education programs. Implications: Older adults of color 50 years and older are sexually active, lack accurate information about HIV/AIDS and are in need of HIV/AIDS education. Methodological issues and recommendations are made concerning ethnically diverse older adults and HIV/AIDS. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- The aims of this study were to determine the association between service utilization and subjective cognitive complaints among adults with HIV and to identify the predictors of cognitive complaints as a step forward in improving service utilization in this population. Participants were 385 adults with HIV who were receiving care from AIDS service organizations (ASOs) in Alabama. Trained staff administered a face-to-face questionnaire, which assessed cognitive complaints and diverse aspects of service utilization. Significant correlations were found between cognitive complaints and work status, financial difficulties, difficulty getting medical care, legal problems, medication compliance, emotional problems, housing difficulties, counseling for sexual issues, transportation difficulties, and difficulty getting food. Multiple regression analysis identified the following predictors of cognitive complaints: level of education, physical pain, and stress. Given the association between cognitive complaints and service utilization, interventions aimed at reducing cognitive complaints and improving neuropsychological functioning may enhance service utilization and everyday functioning among adults with HIV.

AB- The purpose of this study was to gain a better understanding of the symptoms of psychological distress presented by Latinos living with HIV/AIDS upon their self-enrollment into publicly funded HIV-related mental healthcare. Latinos in this sample presented for care with significantly lower levels of psychological distress than the normative sample across three dimensions of the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI): obsessive compulsivity (p &lt; .05), interpersonal sensitivity (p &lt; .05), and anxiety (p &lt; .05). Symptoms of somatization (p &lt; .05) and paranoid ideation (p &lt; .05) were significantly higher in this sample than the general population. It appears that Latinos are self-enrolling in mental healthcare services, but their presentations of levels of psychological distress are significantly different from those documented among the general population. These findings offer health professionals additional considerations that may increase the extent to which their services are responsive to the particular issues facing Latinos living with HIV.

AB- HIV disclosure among sexually active HIV-infected men who have sex with men (MSM) is a complex phenomenon. To better understand factors that impact the decision-making process regarding HIV disclosure among HIV-infected MSM, the present study analyzed content from previously conducted counseling sessions where HIV disclosure was selected as the primary focus of the session. The counselor/participant dialogue was audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed qualitatively using content analysis. Factors identified as barriers that deter HIV-infected MSM from disclosing include rejection, issues of confidentiality, possible missed sexual opportunities, partner’s HIV status, deferred responsibility, sexual partner type, and public sex environments. Participants identified ethical obligation, the potential for a dating relationship, timing of disclosure, and bidirectional communication as facilitators of disclosure. Findings can be used for policy development as well as to guide social workers and other healthcare providers’ assessment and development of clinical interventions addressing sexual health among HIV-infected MSM as it relates to HIV disclosure.

AB- In the U.S., the reporting and registration of HIV and AIDS cases has been subject to legal instruction for some time; ethical issues of privacy are a core aspect of the debate. U.S. policy requires reporting of most sexually transmitted infections and all AIDS cases. Unlike AIDS cases, reporting of HIV cases by name has generated considerable debate. Argument for and against reporting HIV by name is reviewed. An assessment of the limits of the debate is undertaken, and suggestions for expanding advocacy are recommended to ensure that persons being tested know how their personal information may be used.

AB- This paper examines social and cultural factors influencing care and support for Persons Living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) in two selected Yoruba communities of Southwestern Nigeria. The increase in morbidity and mortality associated with HIV/AIDS especially in Nigeria is attributed to poor attention giving to PLWHA. Reasons for this poor attention seem to be relative on culture basis. Among the Yoruba, the cultural conception of HIV/AIDS and the perception of PLWHA by the people, have negative impacts on care and support for PLWHAs. Despite the various attempts to alleviate the burdens of HIV/AIDS on PLWHAs, the problems continue as a nightmare in that society, and contribute to an increase in the number of people down with HIV/AIDS. To understand the problem, an ethnographic study was conducted in Ilesa and Ibadan where 217 respondents were interviewed through the combination of key-informant, in-depth interviews, focus group discussions and case study analyses. Data revealed that Yoruba conception of HIV/AIDS and the people's perceptions of PLWHAs create barriers against better care for PLWHA. In addition, it was revealed that poverty, illiteracy and inadequate hospital facilities constitute other hindering factors affecting better care and support for PLWHAs.

AB- This study represents an illumination of the voices of Ghanaian women affected by HIV/AIDS. This phenomenological study provides meaningful insight into Ghanaian women's perspectives on living with HIV/AIDS. Emerging from the experiences of the 20 co-researchers is a construction of the phenomenon of living with HIV/AIDS. Core dimensions of this phenomenon include The Pre-Illness Experience, The Core Experience of Living with HIV/AIDS and The Transformation of Self. This article will focus on one of the prominent themes of the co-researchers' Core Experience of Living with HIV/AIDS, namely coping through faith, spirituality, fatalism and hope.

AB- Despite staggering statistics on AIDS, South African respondents to a study about perceptions surrounding HIV/AIDS from populations at risk claim little knowledge about people dying of AIDS or even of attendance at funerals for someone who has died of AIDS. Using data from focus groups, the authors discuss possible reasons for lack of knowledge of deaths related to HIV/AIDS, including: reticence to publicly admit knowledge; avoidance of contact with affected persons; denial of the impact/extent of the disease; and ignorance of disease symptoms or culturally-consistent diagnoses (i.e., familiar explanations consistent with the culture). Speculation about possible implications of this for people infected and affected by AIDS-related deaths in South Africa lead to the conclusion that all aspects of society must be interwoven and mobilized to develop effective responses to HIV infection.

These are: (1) The fight against HIV and the fight against poverty must go hand-in-hand; (2) Underlying social dynamics should be incorporated into an effective HIV-prevention strategy; (3) Listen and act upon what the people who are most affected have to say; (4) Take a bottom up approach and build on what is already working; (5) Answer the call to care by partnering with the church (or mosque or temple); (6) Invest in your volunteers and keep them from burning out; (7) Remember that most orphans are teenagers, and plan accordingly; and (8) If it's not a quality-driven service, it's not worth doing.

AB- The terms "AIDS" and "Africa" are often assumed to be inextricable, Africa is a huge, diverse continent and HIV has not affected African countries equally. The pattern of HIV prevalence across the continent has been shaped by factors associated with (1) poverty and economic underdevelopment; (2) mobility and patterns of community instability, including migration and social disruption due to war and political unrest; and (3) gender inequalities. Among countries in southern Africa, South Africa has the world's second largest number (5.5 million) of people living with HIV and in Swaziland there is a 33 percent HIV adult prevalence, the world's most intense epidemic. HIV prevalence rates are also high in Botswana, Lesotho and Namibia. In Central and East Africa, HIV prevalence rates are not as intense but range from 4 to 13 percent, with recent declines in Kenya and Ethiopia, but increases in Mozambique. While Africa remains the global epicenter of HIV/AIDS, some favorable results from HIV prevention and intervention efforts are present. This special issue is devoted to highlighting some of the current trends in HIV prevention and intervention studies across various African countries. This Africa issue closes with a book review, one that reasserts the several points made in our featured articles. AIDS crisis in Africa provides insight into how Africa became the "scapegoated other" of the AIDS pandemic as well as the human nature of response to disease-both within and outside the center of the epidemic.

AB- This study compared the grief reactions of people who mourned three different types of death: Cancer, HIV/AIDS, and suicide, and addressed the question whether these bereavement groups can be differentiated on the basis of their grief, as measured by the Grief Experience Questionnaire (GEQ; Barrett & Scott, 1989). The results indicate that these groups (cancer: N=50, AIDS-related: N=50, and suicide: N=50) had different grief reactions, specifically, in the areas of stigmatization and unique reactions to suicide. The implications of these results afford grief counselors, health-care providers, and pastoral professionals, intervention strategies that enfranchise people, who may experience one of these types of deaths, to work through their grief. Furthermore, this understanding of specific grief characteristics can also be assimilated into a therapist's preferred bereavement paradigm, for example, stages of grief (Kübler-Ross, 1969), phases of bereavement (Parkes, 1972), or tasks of mourning (Worden, 2004).

AB- This article reports findings from a qualitative study of HIV-related knowledge and attitudes of Guyanese social service and health care providers. Social service and health care practitioners were asked to comment on beliefs and experiences regarding HIV and stigma, readiness to treat persons with HIV, and observations of cultural norms and prevailing attitudes. Two focus groups and six individual interviews led to insights about cultural and economic realities which support or obstruct education and treatment. Themes emerged in the areas of public attitudes and professional practices regarding HIV. The findings suggest that work is needed in Guyana to educate the public and prepare professionals for a burgeoning HIV pandemic. Educational, service, and political efforts should involve Guyanese people and systems at every stage. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Very little is known about the extent to which HIV care and prevention providers who work for U.S. community-based organizations are affected by the types of stigma that have been well documented as impacting those living with HIV and those who provide direct care to these individuals. To explore the existence and characteristics of this phenomenon, the HIV Provider Stigma Scale was developed and administered to 795 HIV service providers in 47 U.S. states. Stigma levels were higher among those whose sexual orientation was reported as heterosexual and those who had worked in the HIV field for less than 5 years. Those with the highest levels of stigma also reported decreased levels of social and occupational functioning. The extent to which the social stigmas of HIV and AIDS impact those who work professionally in the field could have important implications for the continued sustainability of the workforce, particularly in areas of the world with still developing HIV service infrastructures.

AB- This paper explores the potential for extending the use of a 40-item stigma scale, developed by Berger and colleagues, to older adults with HIV/AIDS. The increase in the numbers of adults living into older age with HIV, along with new infections in those 50+, makes this issue relevant. A sample of 25 older adults completed the stigma scale, and all answered a semi-structured question about how they felt the scale captured their experiences of stigma. The sample ranged in age from 50 to 72 years (M=56.1±5.75); 38% were female, and 40% were people of color. The stigma scale and its 4 subscales showed excellent internal consistency ranging from α=.92 to .96. The scale was found to have good convergent validity with the CES-D depression scale. Sixty-four percent of the respondents felt the scale did a good job capturing their experiences of stigma as older persons living with HIV/AIDS or offered no suggestions for improvement. The scale was found to be reliable and valid for measuring HIV-stigma in the original study and appears to maintain its integrity in a sample of older HIV-infected adults.

AB- This investigation examined reasons for having sex among a sample of 369 African-American and White adolescent detainees, aged 14-18. Using A-CASI technology, sociodemographic variables and motivations for having sex were assessed among this population. Findings indicated that adolescents hold underlying motivations for having sex and that these differ to some degree by gender, SES, but less by race.

AB- As HIV prevention has become more focused on evidence-based interventions and service provision for people living with HIV (PLH), providers are faced with challenges engaging and retaining PLH in prevention programs. Lessons learned by intervention facilitators may assist service providers address these challenges. To this end, 12 facilitators of a randomized behavioral intervention, designed to reduce sexual risk among PLH, participated in qualitative feedback groups regarding the challenges engaging and retaining participants and strategies used to overcome barriers. Qualitative methods revealed key components to tailoring prevention programs to successfully engage PLH: making interventions personally relevant, teaching skills that can be applied to participants' life contexts, providing support and consistency, and challenging resistance to sexual behavior change.

AB- This issue includes several articles exploring themes of stigma, societal attitudes, and the public's perceptions of control and responsibility while highlighting the need to consider the attitudes, knowledge, and motivations for behavior for both HIV-affected populations and service providers. One area in which HIV-related stigma has greatly influenced societal attitudes and the public's perceptions of control and responsibility is the expression of sexuality, that is, who can express it and under what circumstances. In recognition that persons living with HIV experience stigma and fear of judgment with regard to discussing sexual behavior with service providers, one article present lessons learned about participant engagement and retention in an HIV-behavioral intervention designed to reduce sexual risk among people living with HIV utilizing qualitative feedback groups. Another article examined the reasons for having sex among a group of adolescent detainees aged 14-18. Other article continues the focus on stigma assessment in their article describing the development and utilization of the HIV Provider Stigma Scale administered to a large number of HIV service providers in 47 US states. This issue closes with a book review, also related to changes in prevention behavior and related attitudes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- This study sought to uncover the prevalence of continued drug use and statements about everyday adherence decision-making from a community sample of HIV-seropositive individuals with a history of substance use and also enrolled in antiretroviral therapy (ART) for at least six months. Ninety participants attended one of three focus groups and, collectively, generated 100 statements describing their day-to-day motivations and barriers to HIV-medical adherence. In addition, participants' self-reported substance use revealed that just under 40% (n = 33) were juggling substance use and their HIV medication regimens within the past 30 days. The statements reveal varied and complex adherence factors, which included relatively more non-drug-related than drug-related factors. Further, participants non-drug-related statements covered a broad range of reasons related to adherence that tended to fall into the same major categories as those found across other subgroups: system, disease management, patient-provider relationship, and individual factors. The authors discuss the need for providers to consider the breath and complexity of adherence factors that impact readiness to initiate and adhere to ART for this population.

AB- High levels of medication adherence are crucial to the success of HIV treatment. Consequently, substance abuse counselors (SACs), social service and other care providers can best support their HIV positive clients when they understand adherence and related interventions. This paper describes a training program that was designed to increase counselor knowledge of HIV medications, adherence strategies and enhance counseling skills specific to HIV adherence. For substance abuse counselors the training needs included: better understanding of medication interactions, relapse, recovery, and interdisciplinary communication. Thirty-six SACs from three agencies completed the 11/2-day training, which included lecture discussions, case discussion and interactive client case simulations. Success in accomplishing training objectives was evaluated at three points: pre-intervention training, post-intervention, and six month follow-up to determine changes in participants' knowledge, attitudes and behaviors related to adherence counseling. Three case scenarios measuring counselor comfort levels indicated SACs felt significantly more comfortable discussing relapse and medication issues with their HIV affected clients than they would in discussing medication issues with the client's physician. However, they felt slightly more comfortable about physician discussions after training. Open-ended comments by SACs at six-month follow-up provided insights into recovery issues their clients faced. The findings suggest ways medication adherence could fit the reality of serving clients with co-occurring HIV and substance use to better meet their health and support needs.

AB- Individuals living with HIV disease often have great difficulty adhering to drug treatment regimes. In order to improve treatment adherence clients were referred to a specialized adherence counselor for intensive adherence counseling and education. Instruments were developed which integrated research tools into on-going clinical assessments. The first 30 clients who received adherence counseling were tracked for at least one year in order to assess treatment adherence; 33% were discharged as adherent and 40% exhibited improved adherence; only 10% still had problems with adherence at the 12 month follow-up. This paper describes the role played by specialized adherence counselors and provides a summary of the guidelines that were developed throughout the course of this project. Strategies are offered for helping with diverse adherence problems describing how "to do" adherence counseling directed towards clinicians working on the front line to improve adherence.

AB- We developed an adherence counseling program to help HIV-positive, opioid dependent patients, receiving primary care in methadone clinics, to improve adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). The intervention is conducted by paraprofessional adherence counselors and consists of six, semi-structured counseling sessions that focus on motivational interviewing and cognitive-behavioral skills training. To date, we have enrolled 119 patients into adherence counseling, suggesting that patients are interested and receptive to the program. Clinic staff has welcomed the additional support provided by the program, and are working collaboratively with the adherence counselors to provide integrated and comprehensive care. The successful implementation of the adherence counseling program indicates that paraprofessionals can effectively be trained to provide semi-structured adherence counseling and that adherence interventions can be incorporated into existing substance abuse and HIV-related treatment programs.

AB- Using data from the second follow-up of the HIV Cost and Services Utilization Study (HCSUS), we investigated the influence of social and religious support variables on treatment adherence for Whites, African American and Hispanic HIV patients. Study results show differential effects of social, religious support and background variables on treatment adherence. In general, for Whites, background variables such as educational levels and age were found to be significant variables affecting treatment adherence, in addition to some religious support variables. On the other hand, for African Americans and Hispanics, religious and social support variables were influential. Results also suggest that strategies to improve treatment adherence may vary for different race/ethnic groups. The study highlights the importance of working with and involving religious organizations in an effort to increase adherence and support to HIV-infected members, particularly among African Americans and Hispanic communities.

AB- Lack of adherence to medication regimens among people living with HIV/AIDS can lead to new drug resistant strains of the virus as well as continuing spread of the disease. Due to suboptimal adherence, the prevalence of these resistant strains continues to increase, posing a serious public health risk. Adherence to the various medications must be 95-100% complete in order to be considered adequate; however, 57% to 77% of patients fail to reach this level of adherence. Treatment of HIV-infected persons with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is often challenging due to the presence of factors that can affect adherence, such as complex regimens, total pill burden, and food dosing restrictions. This study seeks to identify factors that predict medication adherence among HIV positive adults. Independent variables included adherence information, adherence motivation, adherence behavioral skills, demographic factors and environmental factors. Results from the exploratory study using a convenience sample of patients lend support to Fisher's Information-Motivation-Behavior model of HIV prevention. Implications for research and practice are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- In the last 10 years HIV has become a disease that can be effectively managed using antiretroviral medications. However, many factors affect adherence, including demographics, income, housing, mental health issues, and access to health care, as well as types and quality of social support. This paper summarizes results regarding specific sources of social support that are part of a larger, randomized study of medication adherence among people with HIV/AIDS. Results summarize findings from 98 program participants and include information regarding support from partners, family and health care providers, as well as the impact of support from these sources on medication adherence. Among participants in this study, those with higher levels of social support from partners demonstrated higher rates of medication adherence. Those who received more social support from their families, however, reported significantly lower adherence rates. These results suggest that efforts to improve medication adherence need to address the diverse types of social support networks of people diagnosed with HIV/AIDS.

AB- This article reviews studies of psychosocial predictors of Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) among HIV positive clients. Unstable housing and lack of HIV-specific social support predicted low HAART adherence in the studies where they were tested. The most consistent predictor of adherence problems across all populations and measures was active substance use, particularly cocaine use. Younger age and less than high school education were not consistently predictive. Depression predicted adherence problems measured by self-report but not by electronic monitoring. Supplementing the adherence support efforts by physicians, nurses, and pharmacists, clinicians in a range of disciplines and settings can assess and intervene on psychosocial risk factors and thereby reduce adherence problems regardless of their level of knowledge about HIV medications.

AB- Maximizing treatment adherence is essential for optimizing clinical outcomes among HIV/AIDS patients. A decade after the introduction of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART), numerous achievements and continued challenges are evident within research on HIV treatment adherence. In this paper, we illustrate some key themes within current treatment adherence research by highlighting presentations from a recent conference focused on this topic (the 2006 NIMH/IAPAC International Conference on HIV Treatment Adherence). We then discuss several ongoing challenges confronting the field, and suggest that multidisciplinary research will be essential for overcoming these challenges and strengthening our efforts to improve and sustain adherence to HIV treatment.

AB- Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) can significantly improve the health outcomes of people living with HIV. Documented to suppress the rate of viral replication in the body to undetectable levels, decrease incidence of opportunistic infections, and delay AIDS progression, HAART offers the prospect of living longer with an enhanced quality of life. This special volume focuses on knowledge, strategies, and approaches relevant to supporting treatment adherence. Contributors are psychosocial researchers, social workers and other social service practitioners, educators, and policy advocates in the advanced theatre of HIV and HAART intervention. Featured in this issue are a rich and comprehensive collection of articles. We begin with an assessment of the state of the field and a global overview. Two of the articles present results from research to develop adherence counseling interventions that are informed by empirical and practice wisdom. As these articles point out, adherence programs are often integrated into existing clinic programs, social work and/or case management services. These integrative models of social service practice may address the varied and multiple challenges associated with medication adherence. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- With the incidence of HIV/AIDS infection continuing to increase among young, African American men and women, it is necessary to examine the breadth of their knowledge on HIV prevention strategies. This study assesses the reported knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors of students attending a Southern urban commuter campus at a Historically Black University. Major differences among males and females, as well as factors influencing testing, issues of safer sex, and perceptions of being HIV infected are examined. The cross-sectional survey data was collected using a self-administered instrument with 238 African American female and male students. Knowledge of transmission was relatively accurate. The majority of students were aware of testing services available to them, though less than 50% of the students reported using services on campus or in their community. There were several significant gender differences in attitudes and knowledge about social supports and condom use. The findings are important for social service providers to consider when developing and/or integrating HIV prevention into a culturally responsive service delivery approach.

AB- A community-based participatory research (CBPR) project was created to study the effects of changing HIV testing protocols on client risk behaviors in an urban area. Concerns raised by the agency advisory group led to development of research questions that needed to be addressed within the community. The article focuses on development of the research partnership and study enrollment during the first year of the project. Challenges of assimilating rapid advances in health technology while conducting outreach to high-risk clients are discussed. Successes and lessons learned are described, including adaptation of theory-based interventions to research protocol and multi-level community coordination.

AB- Worldwide, there is growing policy support for providing integrated HIV/AIDS services. Accordingly, this paper examines the challenges as well as the merits for implementing an integrated approach to HIV/AIDS services in Canada. Through a discussion of the interconnections between HIV/AIDS prevention, support, and treatment, the author outlines how these issues are fundamentally intertwined in the lives of people living with HIV/AIDS (PHAs) and those at risk of HIV infection. This suggests that provision of comprehensive HIV/AIDS services requires approaching these issues from an integrated perspective. The author outlines two existing models of integrated HIV/AIDS services to show the potential viability of such an approach, and concludes with policy recommendations to support service integration.

AB- African American women involved in high-risk, substance use-related behaviors are affected by extremely high rates of HIV infection. While research has demonstrated that HIV is preventable, in order for prevention efforts to be successful in reducing disparities, perceptions of African American women who use crack cocaine need to be taken into account. This qualitative study presents results of eleven focus groups with eighty-nine African American women respondents presenting their perceptions of service needs and preferences for service delivery. The results indicate two important findings for social service providers: the respondents' lack of a perceived need for HIV prevention services as a spontaneously identified need, and respondents' desires for more basic services such as childcare, safe shelter, basic necessities, and especially substance abuse treatment before they could be approached about HIV prevention services. The findings are relevant for developing gender- and culture-specific prevention strategies to reduce the spread of HIV.

AB- Data from the Alcohol and Drug Services Study, 1996-1999 (United States Department of Health and Human Services [USD-HHS], 2002), a nationally representative sample of 2,351 drug treatment programs were examined to identify organizational predictors of specialized substance abuse treatment provision to seropositive clients. The Political Economy Perspective developed by Wamsley and Zald (1976) was used to interpret results. A minority of facilities (22%, 517) provided specialized treatment. Among internal political economy measures, provision of mental health (p &lt; 0.01), basic HIV services (p &lt; 0.05), as well as methadone maintenance treatment (p &lt; 0.05) were significantly and positively associated with specialized treatment provision. Among external political economy measures, managed care funding significantly decreased the likelihood of specialized treatment provision (p &lt; 0.05), while parent organization control (p &lt; 0.01) and number of clients (p &lt; 0.01) significantly increased it. Specialized treatment provision was significantly positively associated with proportion of Blacks, Hispanics, seropositives (p &lt; 0.01 for all), and injection drug users (p &lt; 0.05).

AB- The purpose of this paper is to explore the relationship of availability of HIV-related information and emotional support necessary to obtaining appropriate medical care. Multivariate models control for use of professional case management, mental health services, and drug treatment services. Study data were obtained from the first two rounds of interviews from the New York City Community Health Advisory and Information Network (CHAIN). Household information support and professional ancillary services were significantly associated with entry into appropriate medical care. Among participants in appropriate care at the baseline, only professional services were significantly associated with continuity of care.

These surveys were used to assess changing service needs, outcomes, and consumer satisfaction for people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH) and to monitor service delivery in the Boston Eligible Metropolitan Area (EMA) located in Eastern Massachusetts and Southern New Hampshire of the Ryan White Care Act Title I and Massachusetts Title II and state-funded programs. The assessments support the importance of continuing to adequately fund a broad mix of services to support the medical and social service needs of persons living with HIV/AIDS.

AB- This qualitative study is based on interviews with 10 Thai women living with HIV/AIDS in northern Thailand. It is an attempt to learn how individuals who have no access to mental health facilities cope with distress in life. The analysis shows three important factors that enhance coping ability: support and acceptance from families and friends, life purpose, and religious beliefs (Buddhism) pertaining to the acceptance of mortality. It concludes by suggesting the need to recognize other ways of coping beyond the scope of traditional Western psychotherapeutic approaches.

AB- Persons living with HIV disease are reported to be more frequently returning to volunteer or paid work because antiretroviral medications have improved their health, functioning, and productive years. With more HIV-seropositive people available to the workforce, especially as service providers, social service organizations should better understand their experiences, assets, and needs. This article reports on support group sessions with four HIV-seropositive women who were experiencing extraordinary stress levels due to their memberships in several domains: they were living with HIV; mothers of HIV-seropositive and HIV-seropositive-affected children; partnered with HIV-seropositive men; and working in the HIV field. This discussion is intended to illuminate what social service organizations, managers, and supervisors can do to facilitate job performance and satisfaction for HIV-seropositive workers.

AB- Patient empowerment is a recent phenomenon impacting the evolving nature of the relationship between individuals seeking medical assistance and the doctors who provide that assistance. The purpose of this study was to investigate how patient empowerment affects the traditional medical relationship between patients with HIV/AIDS and their physicians. This study employed a basic interpretive qualitative design that used in-depth, semi-structured, face-to-face interviews for data collection. The sample of 14 purposefully selected individuals living with HIV/AIDS reflected diversity in terms of gender, age, race/ethnicity, number of years living with HIV/AIDS, and number of physicians seen for treatment. Data analysis guided by the constant comparative method revealed three themes: Patient empowerment (1) situates responsibility with the patient, (2) redefines patients' perceptions and expectations of their physicians, and (3) promotes a partnership approach to health care. Implications for social service delivery and practice are discussed and directions for future research are recommended.

AB- The present phenomenological study investigated the experiences of 12 gay men living with HIV/AIDS. Results revealed that following their reactions to the diagnosis, most progressed to viewing their lives and their HIV status more positively. Through data analyses, the researchers developed several continuums that describe the HIV trajectory as having empowering qualities. The continuums focus on several cognitive dimensions (i.e., changes in thinking and affect) that represented participants' experiences of obtaining empowerment. The continuums also acted as progress indicators of how well the participants were coping with HIV. The authors offer several implications for mental health professionals working with this clientele.

AB- Over the past two-and-a-half decades, the HIV/AIDS epidemic has undergone dramatic changes in rates of infection, demographics, transmission trends, and life expectancy while continuing to have an enormous national impact. As the epidemic unfolds, research and literature respond to reflect the impact of the changing epidemic on the lives of those directly affected. In this double issue, articles speak to the ever-changing dynamics of HIV/AIDS, in terms of both triumphs and trials of seropositive individuals, agencies and service providers, and policies. Authors employ quantitative and qualitativemethods, but many have grounded their work in qualitative studies, given the importance of this method in advancing knowledge on public health, health promotion, and health care services, and its relevance to studying the lives of HIV-affected individuals. Thus, throughout most of the work presented here, the authors' discussions uncover the processes and meanings of coping and survival in the present context of the disease. The discussions provide insight into how the voices of those living with HIV are integral to informing and guiding future practice, research and policy. Included articles are briefly introduced.

AB- The Transcultural Case Management (TCM) intervention utilizing community health-care workers--Promotores--was designed to increase adherence to Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART) treatment. The TCM model was also expected to help reduce the use of hospital emergency rooms, the number of hospitalization days, and consequently to lower treatment costs among Hispanic HIV-positive male patients. The intervention results, although not statistically significant because of a higher than expected attrition rate and difficulties in accessing patients for follow-up, were in the expected direction. Furthermore, the self-reported quality of life of the patients increased by the development of social networks among patients and by an increased sense of self-reliance and empowerment. Problems encountered in fulfilling the goals of the research protocol, and recommendations on how to improve research in HIV care organizations are also discussed.

AB- Female sex workers (FSWs) 18 or older who reported having unprotected sex with at least one client within the previous month were recruited in Tijuana and Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. After a baseline assessment, participants were randomly assigned to either: (1) Proyecto Comparte Sexo Mas Seguro ("Share Safer Sex"), a theory-based counseling intervention to increase the use of condoms; or (2) time-equivalent voluntary HIV counseling and testing. Participants had unprotected sex with approximately 27% of clients over the one-month reporting period, and approximately 5% of FSWs in both study conditions tested HIV-seropositive. FSWs in the intervention and comparison conditions showed no significant differences in baseline demographic characteristics, sexual risk behaviors, or HIV serostatus, which indicates that randomization was successful. Future challenges entail participant follow-up and evaluation of intervention effects. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- The purpose of this exploratory study was to develop, implement, and evaluate a pilot HIV prevention intervention with one of the most mobile of U.S.-Mexico transborder populations: Mexican/Latino migrant day laborers (MDLs). Intervention development was informed by preliminary research that included an HIV risk survey of over a hundred MDLs, and a focus group to explore the topic of HIV in the lives of MDLs. Both quantitative and qualitative methods were used to evaluate the intervention, and to identify some of the contextual characteristics of HIV risk factors in the MDL experience. For example, the most frequent theme revealed by qualitative analysis was the stressful and vulnerable state of desesperación [desperation], resulting from earning too little money, that participants linked to deviating from their migration goals and succumbing to alcohol and drug use, and risky sex. While empirical results are limited by the small sample of convenience (N = 23), lack of a control group, and loss of about half of the sample by one month follow-up evaluation, findings were encouragingly consistent with intervention goals: Post-intervention data revealed what appear to be substantial gains in carrying condoms (e.g., from 43% to 83%) as well as in knowledge of proper condom use. Further, frequency of sex with risky sex partners decreased in general, while condom use was reported for all sexual encounters assessed during post-evaluation. The theoretical framework used to guide the intervention, a hybrid of the Health Belief Model and Friere's model of participatory education, included visual triggers composed of customized Mexican lottery game cards to elicit discussion of HIV risk and prevention in the MDL experience.

AB- This paper describes the outreach component of the New Mexico Border Health Initiative (NMBHI), one of five Special Projects of National Significance funded in 2000 along the United States/Mexico border by the Health Resources and Services Administration. The initial intent of the NMBHI was to utilize the traditional promotor model of natural helpers within the informal support systems in the communities in which they physically live for the purpose of increasing utilization of HIV/AIDS prevention services. What evolved instead was more closely aligned with traditional street outreach, whereby peers were utilized to engage and inform potential clients about HIV prevention, provide HIV testing and link HIV-affected persons to medical services. Programmatic elements, implications for practice, and recommendations for program coordinators are presented in the paper.

Health service utilization and related issues unique to seropositive HIV Latino populations were explored and findings are presented from two focus groups with Mexican women and men living with HIV in the San Diego/Tijuana U.S.-Mexico border. Cross-cutting border issues (same as Trans-border issues) included lack of continuity in HIV treatment options in Mexico, provider and social stigma of AIDS patients in Mexico, and fears of crossing the border to the U.S. for appointments. Findings indicate a need for coordinated bi-national efforts at HIV/AIDS research and services for border region inhabitants.

The results show that HIV/AIDS patients receiving care along the U.S.-Mexico border are predominantly Hispanics (81%) and men who have sex with men (56%). In general, SPNS participants appear to be socio-demographically similar to the general HIV/AIDS population in the U.S. with a few noted exceptions such as age, labor force participation, and variations in mode of transmission by age and gender.

Five projects were funded as Special Projects of National Significance (SPNS) from 2001-2005, to improve care and access to HIV services along the U.S.-Mexican Border. These projects developed culturally appropriate and innovative outreach strategies, expanded counseling and testing in border communities, assured continuity of care through intensive case management services and increased clinical capacity through provider training.

AB- The present study examines the relationship between maternal disclosure of HIV status to children and key psychosocial variables. The article identifies three key psychosocial characteristics that may play a role in maternal HIV status disclosure to children: HIV-related perceptions of stigma, HIV-related stigma management, and social support. Eighty-eight (88) HIV women with children enrolled in outpatient care at an urban medical center completed the HIV-Related Perceptions of Stigma and HIV-Related Stigma Management measures, the Profile of Mood States (POMS), and items measuring social support and disclosure to children. Mothers who disclosed their HIV status to their children reported significantly fewer perceptions of HIV-related stigma, less use of concealment to manage HIV-related stigma, and more social support than mothers who did not disclose to their children. No differences were found between disclosure groups for physical or psychological distress. The perception of stigma attached to a mother's HIV positive status and strategies for managing this stigma emerged as the principal findings of the present study. These findings provide empirical support for identifying stigma and its management as a central focus for professionals working in the field of HIV and families. Additional empirical research is needed to fully understand the factors that influence maternal HIV status disclosure to children.

AB- This article is a case study of how an African American family that includes a social worker, responded when three members received an HIV/AIDS diagnosis; two of whom are now deceased. It provides a retrospective look at a family's response to the diagnosis and resilience in the face of terminal illness. This is a personal story presented originally at the HIV/AIDS conference titled "A Social Work Response," held in Los Angeles, California in 1997. The article provides insight to practitioners as well as offers a comparative experience for those who have also passed along on a similar journey. This family faced terminal illness many times, but until one of the matriarchs was diagnosed with AIDS in 1989, this was always an illness that happened to someone else's family.

AB- Intensive field studies of HIV testing sites were conducted in order to identify key factors associated with the process of giving HIV positive test results to clients. Direct field observations and semi-structured interviews were conducted with 34 HIV test providers/counselors. Five components of the process of giving HIV positive test results were found: (1) verifying clients' identities, (2) collecting contact information, (3) communicating results, (4) linking to treatment and services, and (5) managing client and staff emotions. Results highlight the complex nature of the work of communicating HIV positive test results. Examples include the problem for counselors when they encounter clients who intentionally mislead site staff in order to obtain another person's test result and the difficulty counselors face in separating their work from their personal life.

AB- The electronic information revolution has important implications for increasing access to health resources and improving health and quality of life for people living with chronic, life threatening illnesses. This article describes the establishment of a community based technology access center (CTAC) in an AIDS service organization. The goals of the CTAC were to increase Internet access among low-income and minority people living with HIV/AIDS. Results of an evaluation of CTAC utilization showed that the goals of increasing Internet access for this particular population were achieved. Content analysis of websites retrieved from CTAC computers indicated that CTAC users searched primarily for commercial, business-related, general resource, and entertainment functions. The CTAC was used less often for searching for health information and for social and supportive functions. Community-based CTACs housed within AIDS service organizations can increase Internet access and potentially improve the quality of life of people living with HIV/AIDS.

AB- Homelessness and HIV are significant social problems that exacerbate one another. While the literature contains a number of descriptive studies on the persons who struggle with these issues, there is a dearth of comparative studies to help social workers better understand the differences between individuals who are HIV-positive and homeless and those who are HIV-positive and domiciled. This study examined the differences in psychological distress, medical illness, care, insurance, and social service acquisition and the impact on service delivery that these differences imply. This study employed a correlational design to examine a sample of 528 HIV-positive persons, 193 homeless and 335 domiciled, who had self-enrolled into care at an HIV-focused mental health clinic. The findings suggest that there are more similarities between homeless and non-homeless HIV-positive persons than were expected. HIV-positive homeless persons were also more likely to access social services such as transportation, housing, and substance abuse treatment. The implications for social workers involved in treatment planning and service delivery are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

SU- AIDS; HIV; Laws
AB- As this issue goes to press (November, 2005), the Ryan White CARE Act (RWCA) is already delayed in reauthorization. This law and its resultant national program have already proven itself as a safety net to serve those most in need without other avenues to afford reasonable access to HIV care and services. Our hope is that the RWCA will be reauthorized by the time this issue appears and that modifications reflect needed enhancements that may be applauded by the social service community. However, early warnings, whether these be from the Administration's principles of Ryan White Modernization or from varying advisors to the administration, show cause for alarm, particularly in the areas of psychosocial and supportive services that are the hallmark of social work and related professions. Efforts to modify public policies affecting people living with HIV, their caregivers, and systems of care must be clearly related to their needs and how to sustain both maximum quality of life as well as extending life through care and treatment. This issue includes a panoply of articles addressing various aspects of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- This paper presents results from a content analysis of HIV-related school policy in North Carolina. A policy assessment tool was developed and applied based on recommendations drawn from the professional literature. Four major policy content areas were identified: (1) access, (2) confidentiality/communication, (3) medication issues, and (4) HIV education. Of 79 responding school systems, 68 had established policies which were compared to the recommendations acknowledged in the literature. Results indicate a general failure of local school boards to implement the type of detailed HIV-related school policies described in the professional literature. Overall, North Carolina school policies lacked statements referring specifically to HIV/AIDS. Specificity is necessary to protect the rights of HIV-infected children to an education in the least restrictive environment and to protect their confidentiality. It is also necessary for policies to specify details related to HIV education of students and staff. Schools received individualized feedback regarding their HIV/AIDS policy, thereby providing the information necessary for policy improvement.

AB- Eighty-five HIV-positive mothers were tracked in a descriptive analysis of progress through a nonprofit organization's program of legal and mental health services designed to assist ill parents in making a permanency plan for their children after the parent's death. Data on service utilization was analyzed using a Hierarchical Classes (HICLAS) analysis, which uncovered an interpretable pattern of services that clearly distinguished basic (e.g., intake), legal, and clinical services. From the HICLAS output we created an index of progress: [no services] &lt; [basic services only] &lt; [basic + legal services] &lt; [basic + legal + clinical] services. An index of mood was constructed from staff ratings of clients during home visits. Multiple regression analyses revealed that the number of different moods observed in a client was positively correlated with progress. Number of moods was also positively correlated with positive outcome, that is formulating a legal permanency plan and/or transferring care of the child to a new caregiver. Mediation analyses suggested that number of observed moods influences progress, which in turn increases the likelihood of a positive outcome. A second study replicated the prediction of mood on progress in a group of new caregivers who were not mothers. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- This qualitative study explores the religious and spiritual supports grandparent custodial caregivers seek from the African-American church. Six female, Christian African-American HIV-affected grandparents living in North Carolina were interviewed. These caregivers perceive God and prayer to be essential to their intrinsic ability to cope. In addition to having the church pray for persons living with HIV/AIDS and their families, the grandparents would like the church to take a more active role in educating the community on HIV/AIDS prevention and in reducing the stigma associated with the disease. They seek little church support for themselves personally, but hope that through the church's efforts, others will not have to endure what they are experiencing. With this knowledge comes better informing HIV/AIDS education program design. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- This study describes HIV education, prevention, and outreach activities, including barriers to providing these services, to clients in rural areas of Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, and South Carolina. We present responses from 222 AIDS service and public health organizations. The questionnaire defined rural "as a town, village, or county with fewer than 50,000 people that is not part of a larger metropolitan area." About one-fourth of the clients served by these organizations were female and about one-third were African American. Among the perceived most successful programs provided were outreach efforts, health education and risk reduction, and one-to-one client education or outreach. However, major challenges to providing these programs were lack of funds and a lack of qualified staff. Social stigma, privacy concerns, and community attitudes also presented additional obstacles to providing services in rural areas.

AB- Newer antiretroviral treatments are adding years to the lives of people with HIV. At the same time, the face of the epidemic is changing to include increasing numbers of people with other diagnoses, especially chronic substance use and/or mental illness, that compromise their ability to secure and maintain permanent housing. Social service providers are increasingly attempting to meet the need for permanent supportive housing. However, many social service providers are new to developing specialized permanent housing, and little practical guidance exists. We use the experience of five agencies participating in the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Housing Opportunities for People with AIDS (HOPWA) Multiple Diagnoses Initiative to explore the potential pitfalls and solutions in developing these programs, from the point of view of providers from social service rather than housing backgrounds.

AB- The purpose of this paper is to examine the concept of capacity building and describe an HIV/AIDS education program for social service providers that implemented capacity building in nine ethnic/racial minority communities in the U.S. Quantitative and qualitative evaluation data from the Targeted Provider Education Demonstration (TPED) will be presented to illustrate a capacity building approach. Training-of-trainers (TOT) was a central mechanism for transferring expertise to local communities, and program effectiveness was demonstrated by having 60% of all training programs in the last project year delivered by TOT trainees. Lessons learned about capacity building became a major outcome of the TPED evaluation. It was essential to provide technical assistance and address organizational development issues in participating community-based agencies. These agencies were utilized as a mechanism of rooting the interventions in the local communities in a sustainable way. Reinforcement of inter-organizational linkages facilitated growth of community capacity. A multi-level model of capacity building that emerged based on the TPED experience is discussed in the context of literature on capacity building.

AB- This article describes a multi-disciplinary HIV clinical training model developed and implemented by the Division of AIDS Education at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey (UMDNJ)-Center for Continuing and Outreach Education (CCOE), the New Jersey Local Performance Site (LPS) of the New York/New Jersey AIDS Education and Training Center (AETC). The Longitudinal Training (LT) model combines AETC, Minority AIDS Initiative (MAI) and other available training resources into an adaptable framework that can be implemented by any clinical training entity (e.g., other AETCs, Public Health Training Centers, Center for Mental Health Services grantees, state health departments, STD/HIV Prevention Training Centers, etc.) to provide needs-based, multi-discipline longitudinal training of healthcare providers so as to enhance the HIV care capacity of community health centers serving predominantly minority populations. In addition to describing the AETC and MAI Programs, this paper will discuss the methods used in developing the Longitudinal Training model and will include styles of training, identification of program successes and barriers, a composite case study and continuous outcome measures.

AB- The epidemiology of HIV/AIDS in New Hampshire (NH) mirrors the rest of the nation (New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services [NHDHHS], 2004); however, the demographics and physical setting of the state are different. With HIV seroprevalence at about 1% and many health care providers working in rural settings with few educational resources available to them, the challenges for keeping providers well informed about HIV/AIDS care and prevention issues are significant. The AIDS Education and Training Center for NH examined several distance learning modalities to determine which would be the best method for the monthly AIDS Seminar Series. The modalities included Real, Media Player and Quicklime, amongst others. This article describes the selection process and our experiences using on-line Webcasts as a way to enhance and achieve successful distance learning for health care providers working in HIV/AIDS in a rural setting. The terms streaming and webcasts are used interchangeably throughout the article. Though streaming is a method of transmission and webcast is an event, they have become intertwined and are often used to describe each other.

AB- The substance abuse treatment and HIV health care systems have different treatment approaches, and many HIV-infected substance users fall through the cracks between systems. Providers are often challenged by the difficulty of engaging and retaining HIV-infected substance users in care and working across disciplines to coordinate services. A Kaleidoscope of Care is a cross-disciplinary curriculum in HIV and substance use, designed to train HIV health care and substance abuse treatment professionals in providing better care to the clients they share in common. It applies adult learning principles to engage diverse professionals in building skills to promote health and adherence, engagement and retention in care, harm reduction, and interdisciplinary collaboration. Early evaluation of the curriculum indicates that it has enhanced knowledge and built skills in serving HIV-infected substance users among providers from multiple disciplines.

AB- The success of medical education is traditionally gauged by performance on written examinations. However, clinical proficiency in real-world situations is difficult to assess by written examinations alone. We developed a novel evaluation tool to measure the development of HIV-specific clinical skills using Standardized Patient Encounters (SPEs). Trainees were evaluated at baseline and after an HIV clinical training module by (1) self-reported confidence with HIV-specific clinical skills and (2) performance assessments using SPEs. Case scenarios were designed to incorporate unique issues associated with HIV that may present to a primary care provider. SPEs were scored based on written documentation including problem list and plan as well as a review of the videotapes by HIV specialists evaluating key elements of clinical skills and decision making. Improvements were noted in multiple facets of the encounters. The use of SPEs enables evaluation of clinical training interventions on the development of HIV-related clinical skill sets.

AB- The articles in this issue highlight the innovative methods for continuing professional education that being used to improve quality and expand the supply of HIV care. Not surprisingly most of these articles report on AIDS Education and Training Centers (AETC) sponsored activities. Even those articles reporting on initiatives from outside the AETC involve AETC participation in their implementation. The articles in this issue underscore the commitment to evaluation as an integral part of professional education. They present evidence on the operation and impact of the training interventions, yet rigorous outcomes evaluation on provider practice is notably absent. This absence attests to the difficulty in carrying out rigorous evaluations of training programs. There are very few published studies of rigorously evaluated professional education programs in any area of health. What studies are published are characterized by modest sample sizes, mediocre participation rates and short term outcomes restricted to provider skills and practices. This issue offers a rare opportunity to showcase innovative training strategies developed for HIV/AIDS professionals. For the practice oriented reader, if one of the programs in this issue strikes your interest, please contact your regional AETC. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Data were collected from 102 psychotherapists providing mental health care to individuals living with HIV at a mental health clinic in the Southeastern United States, for the purpose of assessing the perceptions of therapists with regard to necessary therapy duration for a range of mental health issues and disorders. Analyses were conducted to explore the extent to which therapists perceived the need for different therapy durations for individuals living with HIV rather than those who had not received such a diagnosis. Across all mental health issues assessed, therapists indicated a greater need for therapy duration when an HIV diagnosis was also present, and this generally was consistent without regard to therapist education, demographics, or therapeutic orientation. Given the extent to which mental health care is often a routine component of the HIV social services infrastructure, the findings of this study have important implications for mental health providers, mental health training programs, and the staff and volunteers of other HIV-related organizations.

The clinical social work model is used to explain the behavioral change process when providers were asked to utilize a voluntary and complex data management system to manage clients' HIV care. Through intense psychosocial support and training initiatives, providers were able to alter their behaviors so that they could successfully integrate new strategies and technologies into their practice while providing better quality care to their clients.

A Better Place (ABP), a supportive housing program in New York City that provides housing and social services to HIV-positive individuals with multiple diagnoses (mental illness, mental retardation, developmental disability and/or chemical addictions), is offered as an example of an effective and economical model of service that aims to break the cycle of homelessness by providing comprehensive preventative care with positive long-term results. The structure and functioning of the program, along with two case summaries, are described in order to provide a service framework for practitioners engaged in this field of service.

Interviewees reported several structural impediments to the integration of risk assessment measures and educational/prevention services related to HIV/AIDS including fiscal constraints, enhanced training of staff, hiring of new staff, discrimination by staff and a need for an interdisciplinary approach. Client factors included the stage of recovery potentially interfering with the risk assessment measure process and the behavioral integration of HIV/AIDS education and preventative information.

AB- Best practices must be established across the various points of a continuum of services and care, starting with outreach to underserved, HIV-vulnerable subgroups, to linking all clients to providers, to integrating the care and services to clients through networks of related providers across a range of services, and finally to promoting quality of care and retention of clients over a sustained period. In this issue, three such populations, in different parts of the U.S., are highlighted: domestic violence clients, the chronically homeless, and the rural, isolated populations. In one article, the discussion focuses on the HIV/AIDS social services infrastructure in relation to linking mental health clinics, mental health training programs, and HIV/ AIDS services organizations. In the overall continuum of services and care, outreach to HIV-vulnerable groups begins with an understanding of the context of risk for various subgroups, such as the setting of gay bathhouses that is the focus of a book review. This issue ends with compendium of writings by social work pioneers is a gift to the professions in its snapshots of the historical emergence of the social work ideas and responses to HIV/AIDS as a health issue in the first two decades of the epidemic.

The woman, a member of a Midwestern Indian tribe, was a participant in a larger in-depth qualitative longitudinal study of 55 women living with HIV. The findings about her path to healing provide insights for understanding and serving this neglected ethnic population, and her words eloquently articulate the struggles of women of color living in dignity with HIV. The article explores potential venues for reaching Native women with culturally relevant prevention and intervention methods, emphasizing the importance of Native culture and spirituality.

AB- Purpose: Because of the faith community's historical response to HIV/AIDS, some religious leaders, local community activists, and public health professionals are challenging this institution to get involved in the struggle against HIV especially among adolescents. The paper reviews the historic process and reports findings from a study, which assess Southern Rural Florida pastors' perception of and involvement in STI/HIV prevention education of their adolescent members. Method: Surveys were administered to 43 African-American pastors of three denominations to describe existing STI/HIV prevention efforts targeting adolescents within their churches and pastors' perceptions of the STI/HIV and drug prevention needs of their adolescent members. Results: Forty-two percent of the churches had existing educational prevention discussions focused on condom use, pregnancy and STI/HIV prevention, and what constitutes appropriate sexual behavior, while 58% did not. Pastors with program (83%) and without program (64%) desired specifically designed formal prevention programs. All pastors desired program content consistent with abstinence while 50% and 39% desired additional content on condom use and negotiating safer sex behavior, respectively. Conclusion: The existence of faith-based prevention programs offers hope as churches assume a facilitator role in prevention services; however, their rather narrow and conservative agenda may be perceived as a barrier to effective intervention prevention.

The narrative data indicate spirituality is a significant strength for these men. The participants describe spirituality, a relationship with God, as interactive, integrative, and protective. They indicate that spirituality helps them live with AIDS and alleviates death anxiety. The participants also posit that their experience with AIDS has strengthened their spirituality. Spirituality is an important resource for the men in this study. The data suggests social workers who work with this population explore the salience of spirituality in the lives of their clients.

AB- There is an increased level of concern that current service structures in rural localities are ill prepared to meet the needs of a growing population of persons infected with HIV/AIDS. Persons living with HIV/AIDS in rural localities face greater stigma, limited accessibility, and restricted resources that further isolate this historically underserved population. This exploratory study utilizes a non-probability purposive sample to investigate the perceptions of service providers in rural regions of North Carolina. Investigators developed and administered a self administered survey comprised of quantitative and qualitative questions targeting service provider perceptions about the general public; perceptions about consumers of services; provider self perceptions, and perceptions related to inter- and intra-agency issues. Findings indicate that service providers perceive deficits in public knowledge, social and health services, agency resources, and provider resources. Implications of these findings are discussed as well as the need for continued research efforts. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- With three million deaths and five million new infections each year, the world is falling far behind in efforts to stop the spread of HIV. Young people do not receive explicit prevention information, most jurisdictions ban needle exchange programs, and the mass media does not run explicit public service announcements regarding the importance and proper use of condoms. The cost of preventing HIV infections varies widely, but it always represents a fraction of the cost of providing pharmaceutical treatment for the rest of a person's life. Effective prevention can be as simple and inexpensive as a national leader appearing on primetime television to discuss how the disease is transmitted, urge the use of condoms, and lay out a war plan. Let us not allow political, religious, and cultural sensibilities to stand in the way of science and the allocation of substantial resources and commitment to HIV/AIDS prevention. That is the challenge to all nations and to the world. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)
