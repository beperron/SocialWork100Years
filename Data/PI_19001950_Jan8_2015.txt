AB- Twelve out of 14 psychotic hospitalized patients, who had received relationship therapy administered by caseworkers, improved in their relationships to others, contact with reality, and in use of activities. The caseworkers encouraged patients to engage in activities as a means of gaining and reinforcing rapport. The essential aim of the therapist was to lend friendly support to the patient, and to confine discussion to the plane of present reality without, however, rejecting the irrealities (past or present) raised by the patient. Caseworkers can help in the total treatment of psychotics by fostering friendly personal relationships which furnish the patient with necessary current support.

AB- As a rule, bringing the family of a disturbed child to the clinic after a relationship has been established with the mother is unlikely to help the child. When the father is brought in at the request of the mother the outcome is apt to be completely negative. It is usually the mother with strongly hostile feelings towards her husband who requests that therapy be given him. Rivalrous family situations further contraindicate therapy for both parents simultaneously. They are likely to vie with each other for the therapist's attention. However this can be counter-acted by assigning different therapists for each parent. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- The social worker should work with present reality by avoiding discussions of parental relationships and emphasizing contemporary feelings. The social worker should expect transference of feelings the patient has towards contemporary rather than towards parental figures. The cases studied revealed that the foregoing recommendations were more likely to be followed when a psychiatrist was administering therapy at the same time that the social worker was rendering his services. However, those workers who followed these principles were no more successful in their therapies than those who followed a more flexible approach in which techniques were varied to meet changes in the situation noted by the caseworker.

KP- CHILDHOOD & ADOLESCENCE
AB- The maladjustment of twins often reflects their twin status in which they experience unusually intense competitive and rivalrous feelings. They are torn between feeling and acting as half of a whole and between their desire for independence from the dependency of this status. Complementary personality development is the rule; and among more rigid twin personalities division of labor attitudes prevail in which a twin expects the personality and behavior of the other to fill the vacuum he leaves. This development is traced to the ambivalent attitudes of the parents, especially the mother. In no event is the environment exactly identical for both twins.

AB- Institutions are personal rather than impersonal bodies. Inmates become aware of institutions through personal contacts with their personnel. While some difficulty in administering out-patient clinic therapy to institutionalized children arises from the fact that the therapist is associated with an outside agency, this handicap can be overcome; and institutions can profit a good deal by availing themselves of out-patient assistance for their children. For greatest therapeutic effectiveness it is recommended that the clinic and the institution operate on a personal and human, rather than perfunctory and impersonal, plane in their relationships both towards each other and towards the children.

The relatives who attended were more likely to be related to psychotic than to neurotic patients. 80% of them said they were helped by the meetings. Attendees tended to emphasize the support gained from the meetings; they felt they understood mental illness better and could adjust better to their patient relatives; they developed confidence in the ability of the hospital to serve as a treatment rather than as a detention center; the group feeling that resulted proved reassuring since it enabled them to enjoy the company of other similarly situated relatives.

While 40% of those who entered the agency profited measurably from the counseling, this is no indication that the counseling was proving effective. Positively related to success in counseling were (1) desire of both parents and boy for help, (2) absence of serious emotional maladjustment either among the parents or in the boy. Apparently the main service of the agency was to fill the lack created by inadequate family relations and home life. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Some of the children of the study were selected for nursery care on the basis of the need to improve their mother's emotional attitudes. This proved unsuccessful. The mothers either did not bring their children to the nursery or withdrew them before therapy had been accomplished. If the desire is to change the mother's attitudes it is best to treat her directly rather than try to mould her indirectly through care given the child in the nursery. In cases of home difficulties it is better therefore to admit children to the nursery not on the basis of the mother's need for change but on the basis of the child's need and the ability of the nursery to help him.

AB- 30 children, who had been restored to health by the Blalock-Taussig (blue baby) operation, were studied to ascertain the factors that were related to post-operative social adjustment. While such factors as age of weaning and tendency to have friends prior to the operation were both related to adjustment, the effects of these and similar considerations on the child's adjustment were traced eventually to the kind of maternal attitudes they reflected.

AB- As a rule, mothers work because of economic necessity. The personal problems and attitudes of working mothers are not qualitatively different from those of mothers who do not work; difference, when they do exist, can be traced to the pressures in daily living created by working and absentee management of the home. Even those who do not recognize or complain of their problems feel these pressures. Although substitute arrangements are made for managing the home, the family's interpersonal relations reflect the resulting pressures. In some cases the mother's absence from the home intensifies pre-existing problems; and, in a few rare instances, the working women appeared to be absenting themselves from home in an effort to escape uncomfortable family situations.

AB- 30 cases taken from the files of the Bureau of Child Guidance of the New York City Board of Education were studied. There were 18 girls and 12 boys ranging from kindergarten to seventh grade and in IQ from 79 to 154. Stated fears centered around the school or teacher (16 cases), other children (6 cases) and of something happening to the mother (4 cases). 23 children were withdrawn but 19 were willful and demanding toward their parents. Symptoms tended to involve mother-centered fears. In 9 cases the basis for the problem seemed to be in the parent-child relationship while in 17 more this relationship was an important factor. Treatment was considered successful in 9 cases, unsuccessful in 8. The more intelligent children in kindergarten or first grade who do not completely dominate their mothers seem more amenable to treatment. Boys responded better than girls but also had more of the above characteristics. Early attention to getting the child back in school seems important.

AB- A letter was sent to 52 patients referred to a psychiatric out-patient clinic by other clinics in the hospital, asking them to come in for a prior interview with a social worker. 30 responded and a slightly greater proportion of these kept subsequent psychiatric appointments than among a control group who did not have social work interviews. Interviews were informal and aimed at explaining the clinic, reassuring the patient, and gathering pertinent case history information. Patients tended to welcome the information and reassurance. Psychiatrists felt the interviews saved time for them. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Casework was undertaken with 28 women with I.Q.'s between 50 and 80. In 60% of the cases some of the agencies objectives were achieved. Factors associated with unsuccessful cases were I.Q.'s below 60, no sense of problem on part of client, and little affection for children. Least successful objectives were budgeting and proper child care. Half of the cases required no financial assistance. The author concludes that case work with such a group is worthwhile.

AB- An attempt is made to determine what factors are related to favorable casework results in adolescents. In 27 cases 59% were making good or improved adjustments when the case was closed. Success was associated with a friendly and outgoing attitude, previous good relationship with an adult, cooperative attitude toward treatment, and good ability to form a relationship with the caseworker quickly. Lack of success was associated with inability to make friends, generalized aggression, withdrawing, and a vague idea on the part of the client as to why he went to the agency.

In general, less disturbed patients used the service more effectively. Numerous examples of how catatonic patients used the service are given.

They disliked school, and there was some indication of a higher than average incidence of social and emotional problems. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

Case records on 27 stepmothers and their stepchildren who had come to a child guidance clinic are analyzed for the step mothers' attitudes toward the stepchildren, and the attitude of the children toward the stepmothers. A wide variety of attitudes was found. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Case records of 49 unmarried Negro mothers living in Washington, D. C. were reviewed. Guilt was more evident in middle than in the lower social class and tended to be negatively correlated with the acceptance of the illegitimate pregnancy by the client's family. Promiscuity was less acceptable than illegitimate pregnancy. More than three-fourths of the cases accepted illegitimate pregnancy with little or no evidence of guilt over violating a moral code. General emotional adjustment was unrelated to attitude toward illegitimacy. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

They were distinguishable by their close ties to their mothers, by inability to express aggression toward their mothers, and by a desire for help.

Naturally, this adjustment depends somewhat upon intelligence, and it does not become thoroughly 'normal' until an I. Q. level of 70 is reached. In the childhood years the attitudes of the parents plays a very important part in determining degree of adjustment, but this factor becomes less important as late adolescence and young adulthood are reached."

In treating delinquency the following mechanisms need to be clarified: (1) the primary instinctual need served by the act; (2) the unconscious frustration or the inhibiting mechanisms that tend to hold this instinctual drive in abeyance; (3) the unconscious aggression against the initial perpetrator of the frustration; (4) the feeling of guilt which is invariably expressed in some part of the act; (5) punishment mechanisms set in motion by the delinquent himself; and (6) a specific set of external circumstances that periodically sets in motion the delinquent act.

AB- Of 100 boys who had been treated by the Worcester Child Guidance Clinic between 1929 and 1936 and were subjects in a follow-up study between 1938 and 1942, the proportion in military service (55%) was comparable to that of the same age group in the general population. Families of 42 of the men in service were interviewed in the spring of 1945 to determine the quality of adjustment to the service made by the previous patients. About as many made satisfactory as unsatisfactory adjustments. Symptoms at time of treatment were of no value in predicting adjustment to service years later. Patients who responded well to treatment and who were well adjusted at the time of the follow-up study tended to adjust better to the service than those who did not respond and/or were poorly adjusted at the time of the follow-up.

AB- Case records of 44 children who had at least one alcoholic parent were reviewed. The author concludes that treatment is less likely to be successful with this group than with a group of unselected clinic referrals. Poor parent-child relationships and a tendency for both parents to be unstable, even when only one is alcoholic, are considered to be important factors in limiting treatment effectiveness.

AB- Case records of 25 children with IQ below 85 were matched with an equal number of records of children with IQ of 115 and above. Therapy with the duller children was at least as effective as that with the more intelligent. The duller children required fewer hours of treatment, possibly having simpler problems. Dull children tended to present problems which were more externalized. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- A survey is reported of 38 cases treated by social case workers at the Hartley-Salmon clinic over a 10-year period. If the child's problem was mainly one of his feelings about himself, if the parents were interested, and if the case worker concentrated chiefly on building ego strength, favorable results were generally obtained. If the child presented another type of problem, favorable results were largely dependent upon the mother's attitude and personality. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Case records of 25 dominating fathers and 26 children (22 boys and 4 girls) were examined. Fourteen boys were oldest children and 4 were only children. Fourteen cases were originally presented because of school problems. Motivation for domination was either compensatory gain (neurotic), consolation for unfulfilled ideals, cultural pattern of authority, or a combination of the first and last. Fifteen of the children were passive, submissive, and dependent; 6 were rebellious and resentful; and 5 were passively resistant. Treatment was most successful for children only if fathers changed also, but favorable factors were improvement in the mother-child relationship, the child's being in adolescence, or the child's being able to establish a good relationship with the psychiatrist. Fathers motivated by cultural pattern were most successful in changing their attitudes. Results with the neurotically motivated group were neglible.

Improvement in the child in the first period of treatment, some insight by parents into their relationship to the problem, and a desire on the part of the parent for help were the only criteria which were at all predictive of improvement in the second period of treatment.

Interviews were directed at reducing relatives' emotional tensions by explaining the social psychiatric history, the functions of the social service department, routine hospital services, and court procedures. The time and informants for the social history were selected, and relatives were given an opportunity to ask questions and talk about the patient. The interviews are beneficial to both the relatives and the hospital. Twelve case histories are given. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Eleven families treated in the Judge Baker Guidance Center were studied. All 11 mothers directed destructive aggression toward both the husband and child and provoked aggression in the children. Under treatment the mother tended to improve if her life pattern was well organized or to get worse if she was already unstable. In general, if the mother was aided by the clinic, the father became worse, and vice versa. The parent who sought clinic aid was the more likely to improve. Nine of 13 children improved under clinic treatment. In two families, both parents benefited from clinic contacts. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- From the sociological viewpoint, the purpose of foreign relief and rehabilitation is to re-establish social processes in such a way that the security of nations is assured. In setting up new or restoring old institutions for the work, we should be definitely clear as to the social and psychological consequences. The author discusses implications for relief and rehabilitation operations, and shows how we can help such people to avoid pauperization and to help themselves. Some practical suggestions are presented for compilation of data in advance of operations and by persons scientifically trained. These data should cover in detail food, clothing, shelter, medical and dental services, agricultural practices, employment and business practices, family life, and community organization and attitudes.

AB- The amount of psychiatric service available for the Selective Service system has been far from adequate for comprehensive examinations. The authors suggest that social service workers be added to the staff of draft boards or selective service headquarters for the purpose of securing the needed information in regard to men who are suspected of susceptibility to mental disorders. Three series of case studies are presented as evidence. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- The author finds, from a random selection of 25 cases, that a client who has made a satisfactory adjustment to his problem is nearly always the person who has attempted independently a constructive solution, although he failed and had to come to the agency for help, without undergoing any serious deprivation of his basic needs. He was able to ask for this help without undue emotional reaction. The client who has not made a satisfactory adjustment with the help of the agency was nearly always the person who had to undergo a serious degree of deprivation before coming to the agency for help, who felt upset about his need for dependency upon the agency, and who tried to use the agency for the purpose of dumping his entire problem on the case worker. It would appear, therefore, that potential success or failure can be fairly easily predicted on the basis of data obtainable in the first interview.

The psychologist's duties are, therefore, testing clients by appropriate psychometric methods for the case worker, making reports of the observations, and sharing through publication with others in similar work the findings of such research.

The factors involved in adjustment seem to be relationships at home and in the school and the child's own capacity for growth. Among these, parental relationships are of paramount importance in the adjustment that a child makes during his first 5 years in school. The most satisfactory and sound adjustment was seen where all 3 of these factors were positive. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- From the follow-up studies of 140 dementia praecox patients paroled after insulin shock therapy, the authors found that those who failed to adjust well in spite of favorable environmental situations and those who were able to achieve success in the face of decided environmental odds, represent only a small minority. This means then that a large majority of such patients must be helped and encouraged by a friendly and favorable reception in order to be able to take up their lives outside the hospital with satisfaction to themselves and to their family, friends, and employers. Social workers can make important contributions in this regard. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

The next step is to consider carefully what data are needed and how they are to be secured in answering the proposed question. After this is done, the research worker in case work is confronted with the problem of how to use the data meaningfully. Knowledge of sampling and of other means of avoiding bias is necessary, to be able to judge when differences are large enough to be considered significant.

Analysis of these case histories reveals the important rôle that anxiety plays in the decision of the parents to discontinue treatment. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

Play therapy is not a definable method and requires a highly individualized approach. Therefore, it may fail to help the child overcome his difficulties if not safeguarded by psychiatric and case-work supervision. Bibliography.

AB- The method of predicting adolescent pre-psychotic personalities is unsound. We know that some individuals with withdrawn personalities will become schizophrenic, but this is quite different from saying that all withdrawn types are potential schizophrenics. Even more dangerous is the consequent attitude on the part of clinical practice in dealing with such behavior problems in children or adolescents. Our function should be to help them in their struggles toward maturity and adjustment rather than to put ourselves into the same restraining position as that which helped to cause the original behavior.

The study suggests that attention should be given to the early life histories, particularly to those affectional experiences sustained in the parent-child relationship. Here the psychiatric social worker plays an essential role in securing and evaluating background information. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Some follow-up studies in the readjustment of problem children suggest that their later shifts are often dependent upon intangible emotional factors. For the purpose of analytical and follow-up study, the authors took 85 cases, 50 of whom were described as unimproved and 35 as successfully adjusted at the time of closing at a child guidance clinic. The results reaffirm the hypothesis that the social and emotional development of a child depends upon the latent resources of his own personality on the one hand, and upon the attitudes of society, particularly those of his own family, that encourage or thwart the growth and maturing of his own potentialities on the other.

AB- Seldom, if ever, is a child brought to a clinic for treatment with any real understanding of his misbehavior. He may have treatment thrust upon him by the will of some adult authority or he may be brought for treatment by some deceptive means. Hence there is likely to be in the first interview a feeling of fear and humiliation which must be met and understood by the therapist in such a way that the child gradually becomes able to express his own unconscious feeling of need for treatment in the wish for a continuing relationship with the therapist.

AB- An analysis of the treatment needs of juvenile delinquents suggests that an effective preventive and therapeutic program could be instituted without any very great changes in the resources of a community which would be within the grasp of any city. The addition to the probation office's staff of a trained case worker who would act as a kind of intake supervisor would provide consultation services to the parents as well as to the delinquent children and would refer them to the appropriate agencies for assistance.

AB- The authors attempt to isolate cultural and personality factors involved in the attitudes of Russian Jewish clients toward requesting and accepting financial assistance, and to show how understanding of these attitudes may assist case workers in making social diagnoses. The reason for the selection of Russian Jewish clients was the unusual homogeneity in the religious ideology and the general cultural background. Their investigation shows that clients who are well adjusted adhere to the teachings and ideals of their culture, while those who are maladjusted disregard or overemphasize their culture's ideals. This latter group shows rather demanding, hostile, and dependent attitudes and lacks initiative and practicability in plans for reestablishing independence. The authors conclude that the chief value of their findings is in the diagnostic criteria they imply. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- The Jewish Board of Guardians, New York City, offers to unmarried mothers four alternatives with regard to the disposition of their children. These include financial assistance if needed, foster home, adoption, or supposedly temporary care in the Home for Hebrew Infants for a period up to three years. The last alternative is for those cases in which the mothers are undecided about what to do or cannot put their plans into effect immediately. 30 cases falling under this last category have been analyzed by the author to determine whether or not there were factors differentiating those who finally took their children home from those who eventually gave their children over for adoption or placement. She concludes that when four or more favorable factors (six in all) are present in a case, the child is likely to be finally taken home, while when three or fewer are present some other disposition of him is apt to be made.

AB- The author has selected for a special study a group of 45 workers and their families who lived in one section of Cincinnati and received the minimum WPA wage, which was $60.50 per month for an unskilled worker in Ohio. Her case-study data are divided, with the aid of the interviews, into the following groups: satisfaction, 8; acceptance, 22; compulsory acceptance, 8; and dissatisfaction, 7. She finds that WPA probably fulfils its stated aims fairly adequately. However, changes in living standards make her doubtful whether the implied objective of maintaining "health and decency" is being secured.

For this purpose she selected 100 cases from the Northern New Jersey Mental Hygiene Clinic for special study. She found that social workers' participation is of real importance and that social workers in adult mental hygiene clinics have need of considerable training in the psychiatric aspects of case work, for whatever division of social work they happen to be doing, they must understand emotional problems in order to recognize and procure significant material or to utilize it in their own case-work treatment.

AB- Since the number of persons diagnosed as psychotic is said to be on the increase, the author investigated the work of the Family Society of New Haven, a family agency, for the fiscal year 1937, in regard to psychotic individuals and their families, and studied the effects on the other members of the family of the psychotic persons' being kept at home. The results show that the agency was a assistance in many of these cases because of the services of a psychiatrist available to the agency staff, and that on the other hand the presence of the psychotic individual at home was clearly detrimental to the adjustment of some of the other members in the family. Hence a provision of boarding home care for certain psychotics seems most desirable. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- The Oaks School is one of the few institutions in which juvenile delinquents of borderline intelligence are trained, supervised, and studied. Its aim is to develop in the boys a sense of responsibility to one another and a desire to become socially acceptable, and to develop their abilities so that they may become self-supporting. This study is a follow-up investigation of 20 boys 5 to 7 years after they left the school. "Given institutional training adapted to their emotional and intellectual needs, it would appear that perhaps as many as fifty per cent of seriously delinquent boys of borderline defective intelligence can later make a good adjustment in the community. Not only does that seem to be true, but it has been shown that a well-trained staff can predict very accurately which boys out of a group will become well adjusted and what conditions must be met to help them make such an adjustment."

AB- This investigation is based on the case records of 30 Jewish families whose children, by request of the parents, were patients of the Hartley-Salmon Clinic of Hartford, Connecticut, between January 1, 1935 and January 1, 1938. She finds that for the most part the Jewish children referred to the clinic by their parents were much like the Gentile children. However, there seems to be a factor of significant emphasis which Jewish parents attach to their children's behavior. Some of the reasons why Jewish parents find certain behavior traits disturbing are to be found in the Jewish culture, while others (and to some extent the same ones) bear a close relationship to the parents' peculiar personality traits and problems. She concludes that "behavior of any group of people cannot be adequately understood by reference to individual motivations alone." (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- This study is concerned on the one hand with the kind of cases the family agency refers to the clinic and the sorts of service requested, and on the other with the kind of service the clinic in turn gives; and finally with an analysis of the cooperative work between the agency and the clinic. The material for the study consists of 34 cases (18 girls and 16 boys) referred during 1936 and 1937 to the Hartley-Salmon Clinic by the Charity Organization Society of Hartford, Connecticut. The author concludes that the services the agency wanted most frequently were either psychiatric treatment or diagnostic study, and that the way in which the clinic gave such services in all save one case seems to suggest that the family agency had made a careful diagnosis of the child's difficulty before referral was made. The analysis of the co-operative work between the agency and the clinic shows that a close cooperation is most effective, for the clinic offers to the agency its own specialized service in regard to the treatment of children while the agency is free to work with the parents in the light of the clinic's diagnosis of the child's difficulties.

She found that there was a considerable agreement between the data from her own observation and the teacher's reports to her about the children's adjustment, and that there was a very close relationship between parents' behavior toward the children and the children's adjustment to kindergarten.

AB- This is a comparative study of children of two kindergarten schools in the same city for a period of one semester. One school is definitely better equipped and is supervised by a better qualified teacher, while the other is poorly equipped and is supervised by a less desirable teacher. It was found that the two groups, while they showed very similar distribution in the various adjustment categories in the initial period, differed considerably at the end of one semester. They conclude that unfavorable attention from a teacher, if it duplicates a child's home situation, is detrimental to his adjustment; and that a teacher's favorable attitude is definitely helpful to most children, although it cannot wholly care for the needs of children who suffer severely from emotional deprivation at home.

AB- Using Dollard's definition of accommodation attitudes of negroes, the author investigated 53 negro families to determine the extent of the influence of these attitudes on case work. She found that in about a third of the total number of cases these attitudes were obstacles to case-work treatment. She states that "the actual number of cases affected by accommodative responses may have been greater than indicated here." Hence it is necessary to be aware of these obstacles if case workers are to help negro clients to make an effective use of casework services.

AB- This study is concerned with the achievements of a summer camp conducted by the Psychiatric Clinic of the Massachusetts General Hospital for children with emotional problems. The major line of inquiry in the interviews and case records of 43 children was to compare children who adjusted well in camp and afterward, children who adjusted poorly in camp and afterward, and children whose later adjustment could not be predicted from their adjustment in camp, in order to discover some definite criteria by which such a camp may be better able to select various types of problem children with an expectation of favorable results. Their findings reveal that "children who are apt to benefit from camp are those whose home situations contain some favorable factors, who feel insecure about fancied or real inferiorities to their siblings, who have been able to make some progress through treatment or who, rejecting treatment, are fairly self-sufficient children who appear to be suffering from overtly unfavorable environments."

AB- This study is based on the records of 45 cases, closed as resistive, in the Bronx and Manhattan districts of the Jewish Board of Guardians, New York City. The author recognizes many factors possibly contributing to such situations. She analyzes and discusses such factors as age, source of referral to the agency, patients' personality traits, patients' attitudes toward treatment, parental attitudes toward treatment, parental personality traits, and reasons for children's discontinuing treatment as seen by the case workers. At the end the editor of the Studies has added a section on interrelationship of factors associated with discontinuance of treatment, based on the same data as the analytical summary.

AB- The authors attempted to answer two questions on the basis of case records. Are adolescents different from children of other ages in their response to child guidance treatment? Is there any prognostic value for success or failure of psychiatric treatment of an adolescent child in his personality traits? In regard to the first question, they found very little difference. In regard to the second question, they concluded that "a surprisingly accurate estimate of the probable results of treatment could be made from a study of certain personality traits."

KP- ADOPTION CRITERIA
KP- CHILDHOOD AND ADOLESCENCE
AB- The authors state that "Adoption practice as it now exists in Illinois is largely a legal matter, and its social implications are not fully considered. Many adoptions are effected before the Department of Public Welfare has submitted its recommendations, and if made, they are sometimes not followed." The chief concern here is to suggest certain considerations which should be taken into account, whether an adoption petitioner is "of sufficient ability to bring up a child" and the adoption "is fit and proper and for the best interest of the child." For this purpose 60 cases were selected for study from the adoption children who were examined at the Illinois Institute for Juvenile Research during the two years 1933-35. In the records of those cases it was found that the children adopted under one year old seemed more successful than those adopted above one year old. Adoptions were made mostly by persons who considered themselves unable to have children of their own. The authors feel that there should be a careful study and consultation on the part of child-placing agencies before any adoption takes place. If the motives and desires of the parents wanting children are uncovered many unsuccessful adoptions may be avoided. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- 30 cases which closed at the Worcester Child Guidance Clinic from 1935 to 1937 were divided between successful and unsuccessful treatments. Among the eight personality traits found significant as criteria, the most significant factor was the capacity to carry out plans and to make adjustments in the face of frustrations. Other important factors were a satisfactory marital adjustment, inferiority feelings, an attitude of real affection toward the child, and a normal amount of social interest. The mothers who were not successful in the treatment were lacking in the capacity to achieve goals, frequently had an unsatisfactory marital adjustment, had excessive social interest or none at all, and were often aggressive, dominating, and hostile under the cover of anxiety. They were deeply dissatisfied and restless. Helping them to gain confidence in their ability to handle situations was the most successful form of treatment.

AB- This is a compilation of theses presented by four students in social work, dealing with 185 children, mostly between the ages of 6 and 21, whose mothers were patients of the Central Islip, New York, and the Rhode Island State Hospitals. The information concerning the children's adjustment was obtained by means of interviews, observations, and discussions with the children and their relatives and friends. The authors classified the children in terms of four categories of adjustment—the well-adjusted children, the quiet, "too good" children, children with localized problems, and children with severe, generalized maladjustment. They found, among other things, that the psychotic condition of mothers is a very important factor for children's social and emotional maladjustment. Hence an adequate psychiatric service should be extended to the children of psychotic mothers to insure proper home environment and a sense of security. Several cases are cited.

AB- A study of the extent and differentiation of services offered to children by a family agency. Of 289 cases active with the Family Welfare Association of Evanston in 1936-1937, the agency was primarily concerned with a child in 72 cases, and was primarily concerned with the total family situation and secondarily with a child's problem in 46 cases. This second group contained cases typical of situations treated by a family agency. Cases in the first group were analyzed in greater detail as to the children themselves, source of referral problems, family situation and attitudes, and methods of treatment employed. The differentiation of services to children was largely a matter of degree, ranging from cases in which the approach to and treatment of the child was closely integrated with that of the family as a whole, to the other extreme in which there was complete separation of the case work with the child from that with the family.

AB- "The chief findings of this review of 120 cases of children severely and overtly rejected by their mothers seem to lie in the statistical confirmation of the opinions of clinicians that such children are generally not amenable to child guidance treatment and in the suggestion that there are certain, fairly well-definable conditions under which such children can be helped. The cases represented the work of five clinics, all of which had a very similar distribution of successes and failures. The patients were, on the average, brighter and younger than the run of child guidance cases, and their parents, for the most part, had at least adequate economic resources… . A search for individual characteristics that distinguished the successful from the unsuccessful cases revealed… . that if a child had a high intelligence or a father who gave him some affection or—much more important—a mother whose rejecting attitude was modified during treatment his chance of successful adjustment was greatly enhanced."

State Hospital showed a code of socially prescribed behavior toward psychotic relatives. This behavior was characterized by reactions of anxiety, fear of the hospital, and refusal to recognize illness, and may have been caused by the emphasis Jewish culture places on the unity and intellectual level of the family group.

In the 11 cases in which the mothers showed a great change, as well as in the four cases showing some change, all the children were successfully adjusted by the end of treatment. In the 15 cases in which the mothers' attitudes showed no change, six of the children were successfully adjusted and nine remained unimproved… . Most of the mothers whose attitudes showed no change during treatment were excessively dominating and aggressive. Many were extremely irritable, excitable, and unreasonable. They were generally self-centered and had a very narrow range of interest. The mothers whose attitudes became greatly changed during treatment were of a different personality type. For the most part, they were very insecure and felt inferior and were extremely conscientious." (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

It dealt with the 32 families who were kept as clients of the agency after the Hamilton County Welfare Department had assumed responsibility for their financial assistance." Consultation service provided a definite means of assisting 23 of 32 families in problems other than those associated with their relief needs. Factors influencing the successful continuation of consultation service were the client's understanding of his own needs and the assistance offered by the agency, and also the ease with which the case worker saw the needs of the client.

AB- Except in one case, placement away from home was not intrinsically a traumatic experience. It tended, however, to precipitate or emphasize conflicts which already existed in the children's emotional lives. Four children who entered foster homes with attitudes of conflict toward their own parents carried over this conflict, in varying degrees, to their foster parents. The displacement of hostile attitudes from own to foster parents tended to prevent satisfactory relationships between child and foster parents and was often a cause of replacement. In general the children related themselves more intimately to foster mothers than to foster fathers. This is attributed to an emotional dependence upon the mother person.

In 10 cases the agency performed specific services, in 3 it helped with financial planning and management, in 4 no help was rendered, in 2 the agency assisted the clients to make environmental adjustments, and in 13 cases the agency treated emotional problems.

AB- An investigation of social and psychological adjustment of 45 dementia praecox patients, under 20 years of age when committed, five years after their commitment. The incidence of adverse home situations and personal maladjustment before the psychotic episode was high. 60% of the homes were rated as poor and 88% of the individuals as inadequately adjusted. The onset of the psychosis was gradual in 58% of the cases. Gradual onset seemed a particularly unfavorable sign, and an adverse early environment was almost equally indicative of a low chance of recovery. The kind of adjustment the patient had made before the psychosis was unimportant as a prognostic sign by itself, but was important when taken in conjunction with the other two traits. Combination of the unfavorable aspects of the three traits was very unfavorable for recovery within five years. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- "The chief objective of the investigation was to learn to what extent the children on a given street in a large city varied in social adjustment and to trace some of the factors that may have led to the differences among them. By selecting one small street with fairly uniform housing conditions certain of the grossest social and economic factors were held constant. By studying all the children some of the difficulties in attributing causal significance to certain factors were avoided… . The outstanding conclusion that emerges from this consideration of some of the factors that might account for the variation in social adjustment displayed by the children living on the same street is the pre-dominating influence of parental attitudes toward the children and the general relation between what are usually considered good parental attitudes and adequate social adjustment on the part of the children, but the various types of maladjustment in parental attitudes seemed to produce rather specific types of reaction in the children. Most of the families in which the children were shy, retiring, or generally socially inadequate had mothers that were, by one means or another, in complete control of the household. Some of them achieved dominance by psychosis or neurosis, others by native ability or by providing the family with economic support. For the most part they over-protected their children, either through excessive solicitude or by undue control of their activities. The fathers were either easy-going, quiet, submissive men or were no longer living at home." (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- "This investigation of the later behavior of a group of delinquents referred by the Juvenile Court for examination at the main office of the Illinois Institute for Juvenile Research had a double purpose: to compare the results of this court-clinic work with that reported by Sheldon and Eleanor Glueck for the Boston Juvenile Court and the Judge Baker Foundation, and to study in a more descriptive manner the children's adjustment and the causes for its variation. The first objective was greatly hampered by the fact that the present investigation was limited to one hundred and nineteen boys and girls compared with the Gluecks' one thousand boys. The second, also, was only partially achieved, due to the paucity of material… . In general, the investigation seemed to indicate that recidivism may not always be as frequent as the Glueck study suggests, that a more favorable showing for the work of court and clinic is made when less mechanical definitions of social adjustment are used, and that a close study of personality trends and environment situations might result in a clearer understanding of why some children do and others do not become recidivists."

"Free discussion" groups were held for clients of the agency. The author concludes that such discussions were of value "as a case-work measure, sometimes in supplementing the case workers' knowledge of their clients, sometimes in increasing the usefulness to the client of the case-work relationship. It increased the capacity of some of the mothers to participate in community life, and it led some to a clearer recognition of reality." (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- The effectiveness of clinical treatment in the later social adjustment of various types of problem children is reported in this series of papers. The evidence gathered in follow-up investigations of cases from thirteen clinics located in different areas of this country points out three main facts: (1) that behavior disorders do not affect later social adjustments except in cases where the children are psychotic; (2) that the results for various clinics are quite similar, even though their methods of treatment differ; (3) that the emotional set-up of the home is far more closely related to child adjustment than are such tangible factors as age, sex, nationality, and economic status.

AB- "This investigation attempted to arrive at an estimate of the value of a work-shop as an aid to child guidance treatment. The shop in question, a part of the Pittsburgh Child Guidance Center, is in charge of a manual arts instructor and is used by the staff as a means of observing, developing rapport with and treating boys who it is thought will benefit by such an experience. The first sixty boys who attended the shop formed the basis for the investigation, the data being secured from the case records in which had been noted such items as the reason for referring the boy to the shop, his initial reaction to it, length of attendance, articles made, quality of work, and so on." "The correlation between the extent to which the work-shop achieved its purposes in individual cases and the general results of clinic treatment was fairly high. Boys judged successfully treated in general were almost all rated as successes of the work-shop; for most of those judged partially improved by treatment the work-shop was considered successful; but among the failures in treatment there was a wide spread. This would seem to indicate that a work-shop is of value in a wide variety of cases and does not merely reflect changes that are being effected by other types of treatment. On the other hand, it also indicates that a work-shop cannot be a substitute for other forms of therapy, and that results achieved within the shop are not necessarily carried over in the outside world."

AB- "This paper describes the intake of the Illinois Institute for Juvenile Research with respect to feeble-minded children whose IQ's indicated their eligibility for commitment to state institutions. A six-months group of such children who were examined during 1932-33 was compared with a similarly selected group examined in 1928-29 with the purpose of determining the influence of the economic depression on that intake. No difference between the two periods in the proportion of feeble-minded children in the total clinic population was found, but there was an increase of about forty per cent in absolute numbers. The depression series was characterized by a larger proportion of young children and of children whose examination was requested by relief and child-caring agencies. A marked reduction in referrals by the court was also noted." These and other considerations lead to the conclusion that the chief influence of the depression on the intake of feebleminded has been a greater use of Institute resources on behalf of the not-so-difficult cases.

AB- This study is an investigation of six generations of a family living in an eastern state. Data were obtained from living members of the family, other informants, social agencies, hospitals, town records, and state institutions. "The line of inheritance of mental disease in this family appears to have been strikingly direct. But rather than being on the increase, it seems to be on the decline, the chances of an individual's becoming psychotic being less with each successive generation. Both of these facts must be kept in mind in drawing generalizations from this family, for both are important. The first lends weight to the theory of direct transmission of mental disease, particularly manic-depressive psychosis, but it gives no indication as to whether the causative factors are biological or environmental. The other emphasizes the fact that even psychotic individuals have many more normal than psychotic descendants, and that the tendency is away from rather than toward progressive deterioration."

In addition to the material obtained from the case records, follow-up visits were made in seventeen cases. All the children who could be located were retested by the writer on both the Stanford-Binet and the Diagnostic Reading tests." "A comparison of the changes in reading ability with the changes in behavior indicated that improvement in one field bore little relation to improvement in the other. Some children improved in both reading and behavior. Others improved in reading but showed no change in behavior, and vice versa. A few did not improve in either field. Modification of behavior symptoms seemed to occur only when the tutoring was supplemented by some form of social-psychiatric treatment, or when the parent-child relationship was obviously satisfactory. The few cases in which such treatment failed were characterized by unusually severe emotional handicaps." (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- This study is an analysis of twenty-six boys referred from the Hartley-Salmon Clinic of Hartford to the Connecticut Junior Republic. The case records of the clinic are analyzed for age, national background, intelligence quotient, and source of referral, and the cases are classified and compared according to personality, emotional tone of the home, parental attitudes, and neighborhood. Adjustment at the Republic and after leaving the Republic is reported. The author concludes that "this specialized form of institutional treatment seems to offer something of value to one definite type of boy (the average adolescent who is of normal intelligence, makes friends, but comes from a poor environment) and, also, to a few other individual boys if they have certain special abilities or capacities which find outlet in the Republic program. The general trend of the boys' adjustments during and after treatment would seem to indicate that what they gain during their experience at the Republic usually carries over after their return to the community."

AB- An "investigation, carried out by seven students of Smith College School for Social Work in five state hospitals,… to test the theory that functional psychoses occur chiefly in individuals whose personality is different from that considered normal and who grew up under unusually irritating or handicapping emotional conditions." Four informants per case were seen for 40 manic-depressive and 68 dementia praecox patients. "Many of the patients, especially the schizophrenics, were described as always having had a personality pattern that differed from the normal. And in a large proportion of the homes handicapping emotional conditions of one type or another were reported. The home conditions seemed somewhat worse on the average in the manic-depressive group, while among the schizophrenics individuals of poor social adjustment were more frequent." "Over-protection, often of an extreme form, was fairly common, especially in the manic-depressive group, and in a third of the cases the mother was unusually dominant and the father played a very weak role."

AB- The findings from four pairs of twins tested in 1925 and again in 1932 are discussed for each pair under the headings: general information and social setting, type of twins, physical findings, psychometric ratings, and personality and behavior reactions reported by parents and observed by the writer, "In general, in neither physical, mental, or personality traits were these twins 'identical.' The monozygotic pair III differed markedly in physical appearance and in intelligence. The dizygotic pair IV was much alike in physical and intellectual measurements. Only Twins II were strikingly alike in personality. It would seem best, then—as others have pointed out—to discard the term that implies duplicate or identical characteristics."

Work, suggested that in the behavior of the parents toward the children who were clinic patients was to be found an index to the probable outcome of treatment. This paper reports the results of testing the reliability of the parental behavior categories; and the findings in an additional hundred and two cases of success and failure." Results are in agreement with those of the original investigation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- An analysis of 72 cases carried by the Family Society of Philadelphia in cooperation with public relief agencies. A large number of the families were white, native-born Americans, with the great majority belonging to the laboring group. The chief factor in determining the level of treatment, described as "relief," "opportunity," "adjustment," or "therapy" was the client's desire for that kind of service. From the large number of cases carried on a relief level and the small number carried on an adjustment or therapy level, the author suggests the general conclusion that only a small number of clients receiving unemployment relief desire case-work help.

AB- A study of 22 cases of stuttering treated at the Institute for Child Guidance, New York. "The chief difference between the various adjustment groups appeared to lie in the relative seriousness of the problems which they presented. The unadjusted were handicapped by both physical and emotional traits and by the attitude of their parents. In the partially adjusted group, handicapping parental attitudes were offset by the patients' more favorable personalities. That the successfully adjusted were even more favorably situated from an emotional point of view is suggested by the fact that they improved under social manipulative treatment. Since these findings are in agreement with those of other studies of child guidance results, the conclusion seems indicated that stuttering may accompany various degrees of personality disorder and that prognosis is dependent on these other attendant conditions."

AB- Three groups are compared: a group of 50 hyperactive children, a control group of 50 non-hyperactive problem children of the same age, and a second control group of 100 non-hyperactive problem children unselected with respect to age. It was found that the groups were practically identical in mean intelligence and frequency distribution of the intelligence quotients. Hyperactivity was slightly more common among boys than among girls; the difference was not statistically significant. The hyperactive children were not underweight, but tended to be of two general types—dull overweight and bright underweight. The only significant difference found in the comparison of the three groups was the difference in age between the first and third groups. The hyperactive children were definitely younger than the run of clinic patients. Data in physical findings and developmental histories were too incomplete to justify definite conclusions.

The ranges in intelligence quotients in the groups were comparable. Age, sex, and the number of children in the family were not constant. The writer found that "there was no relation between speech defects and left-handedness in a family history and reading disability in a patient, but there was a slight tendency for reading difficulties to be more frequent in the families of reading-disability patients than in those of other children."

Degree of cooperation, attitude toward the examiner, and speed in the test showed no relationship to variability in IQ, while degree of reflectiveness and attention were slightly more favorable in the group whose IQ advanced. Improvement in physical condition, parental attitudes, and symptomatic behavior also is definitely associated with variability in IQ. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- During the winter of 1931-1932 the Philadelphia Family Society and the Bureau of Unemployment coöperated in caring for clients who showed a need for some service in addition to relief. This experiment gave some indication of the value of coöperation between a case-work agency and a public agency and showed some of the difficulties which would arise in referring cases needing and willing to accept case work. It was found that there was almost complete agreement between the two agencies on those problems which had overt manifestations, but that the Family Society worker found in addition many problems involving emotional difficulties.

AB- 361 delinquent girls were compared with 361 of the same age and nationality who were non-delinquent. The delinquents came from smaller families than did the non-delinquents, and only children were more frequent among them. No significantly larger proportion of the delinquents than of the non-delinquents were oldest in the family, but the proportion of non-delinquents who were the youngest in the family was definitely greater than was found among the delinquents.

AB- 362 delinquent girls were matched for age and nationality or race with the same number of school girls who lived in approximately the same parts of Chicago as did the delinquents. When the broken home was defined as one from which one or both natural parents were absent, it was found that 67% of the delinquents and 45% of the non-delinquents came from such homes. When the broken home was defined as one containing only one parent, the difference between delinquents and non-delinquents was not so great. The mothers of 38% of the delinquent girls, as compared with 29% for the non-delinquents, worked for wages. When broken homes were held constant, however, these differences largely disappeared. Thus it seemed that the broken home was more directly related to delinquency than was the fact that the mother worked. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Twenty-two foster homes, chosen from those in use by the New England Home for Little Wanderers in October, 1929, were studied to determine the characteristics of a good foster home. The homes had been used by the agency for at least two years, and at least two children had been placed in each. A statistical comparison of these homes showed that (1) nearly all of the foster parents were middle-aged, (2) most of them had children of their own who were approaching adulthood, (3) in social position they were lower middle class, (4) they boarded children partly because they needed money, and (5) the women were largely aggressive and self-reliant. The difference between successful and unsuccessful foster mothers, however, lay in the degree of security they offered to the children. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- The authors studied the records of ten patients of the Cook County (Illinois) Psychopathic Hospital who had been examined at the Institute for Juvenile Research at least two years before their commitment, to discover whether future psychoses can be foreseen, and, if so, in what types of patients. In three of the ten cases the psychiatrist did not predict any later serious mental difficulty, in another four cases the psychiatrist recognized a marked personality difficulty and described the patient as either psychoneurotic or a psychopathic personality, while in the remaining three cases the psychiatrist either recognized or predicted an impending mental disease. In no case did a marked change in personality occur, but in successive examinations a definite accentuation of early traits was noted. These patients had two traits in common: each was described as solitary or seclusive, and eight of the ten possessed violent tempers. The ten cases are presented in detail.

KP- SOCIAL FUNCTIONS OF THE INDIVIDUAL
AB- The author endeavored to discover the possibilities of a single interview and to find out whether short-contact experience could be given to students in some form. The study was carried out at the New York Children's Aid Society, interviewing those who desired either to place a child or to offer their homes for foster children. The writer concludes that short-contact interviewing is of the same essential quality as intensive case work. The first objective should be the securing of as great a degree of participation and responsibility on the part of the client as he is capable of at the time. This was found to prepare for a cooperative casework relationship subsequently. The writer feels that students can be trained for short-contact interviewing if they develop a personal security. The body of the article is composed of numerous detailed histories illustrating different types of applicants. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

There is almost perfect correlation between the degree of cardiac difficulty and the presence of mental-hygiene problems. The majority of cardiac patients, furthermore, do not complain of subjective symptoms. Those who do complain usually have emotional problems.

KP- NAIL BITING
KP- CHILD
KP- CHILDHOOD AND ADOLESCENCE
AB- Numerous factors in the lives of a group of children who bit their nails are analyzed statistically in an attempt to evaluate some popular notions. A control group was employed. The results indicate that nail biting occurs more frequently in girls in the age groups of six to eight years and fifteen years and over. In boys the habit predominates in ages nine through eleven years. It shows no relationship to either intelligence or physical condition, nor is it associated significantly with any one pattern of problem behavior. No evidence was obtained for the popular association of nail-biting and masturbation or nervousness or introvertive tendencies. The chief difference between the two groups lies in the frequency of situations which created tension in the home. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- One hundred patients at the Institute for Child Guidance who had been breast-fed for twelve months or longer were compared with one hundred that had been nursed for one month or less. The factor of chief importance in determining the length of the nursing period appeared to be the mother's attitude toward the child. Women who rejected their children constituted half of the one-month-or-less group, while two-thirds of the women who nursed their children for twelve months or more were described as over-protective.

AB- In a study of the relationship between the childhood experiences of mothers and the attitudes they later displayed toward their children, over-protection appears to be associated with a lack of affection and responsibility. Affection and responsibility frequently characterize the childhood of mothers who display a neutral attitude toward their children, while affection and a lack of responsibility are associated with the attitude of rejection.

AB- Thirty over-protected children were compared with two hundred non-over-protected children. The differences in age at learning to walk, to talk, and to establish bladder control were not large enough to be considered of statistical significance, but they did lean in the direction of earlier learning on the part of the over-protected. 41% of the over-protected children, however, as compared with 7% of the non-over-protected, were breast-fed for twelve months or longer. It appeared that the attitude of over-protection was more effective in altering the mothers' behavior than in influencing the children's development.

Their attitudes toward relief do not reveal either their actual or potential dependency, but indicate their emotional adjustment. The author believes that for the effective use of relief the social worker must be aware of the possible meanings of relief and of the possible interpretations of the attitudes shown by the client toward the relief.

AB- A statistical study based on data obtained from the case record index cards of the Institute for Child Guidance in New York and of the clinics held for demonstration purposes by the Commonwealth Fund. The classifications were accepted at face value and no attempt was made to study the original case records. The data are analyzed so as to show comparisons: (1) descriptive of the patient, i.e., sex, age, IQ, number of children and ordinal position; (2) symptomatic behavior of the patient, such as negativism, fears, sensitiveness, inferiority, fatigability, speech defects, and running away from home; and (3) parental attitudes, mother protection, unfavorable comparison and mother nagging. These data are given in eight tables. Jealousy seems to occur in a slightly larger proportion among girls than among boys, and tends to appear in the earlier ages of childhood. It is somewhat more frequent among bright than among dull children. A larger proportion of jealous than of non-jealous children were first born, particularly in two-child families.
