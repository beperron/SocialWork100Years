KP- techniques of W. H. Masters & V. E. Johnson
KP- treatment of sexual dysfunctions in social casework relationship
SU- Sexual Function Disturbances; Social Casework
AB- Suggests and explores the usefulness of the techniques developed by W. H. Masters and V. E. Johnson for the treatment of sexual dysfunctions within a social casework relationship. The successful use of this approach in a psychology clinic in Seattle, Washington, is described. Its effectiveness seems to be due to 3 factors: (a) Dual-sex teams of therapists are more successful than individual therapists. (b) If the therapy team functions well, it plays a catalytic role in marital communication by encouraging verbal exchange between patients and thus helping them to increasingly understand each other's sexual needs. (c) The premise that attitudes and ignorance rather than psychopathology or physical illness are responsible for most sexual problems is basic to this approach.

KP- client race & social class & extent of pathology
KP- clinical judgments
KP- social workers
SU- Psychodiagnosis; Racial and Ethnic Differences; Social Workers; Socioeconomic Status
AB- 360 professional social workers employed by the State of California received mailed questionnaires with written case histories which randomly varied in terms of client race, social class, and extent of pathology. Subjects were asked to complete a Treatment Decision Inventory (TDI) containing 24 items intended to represent diagnostic, treatment, and attitudinal judgments. 5 factors emerged from factor analysis of the 360 returned TDIs: Factor A, "Assessment"; Factor B, "Suitability for Treatment"; Factor C, "Social Emphasis in Treatment"; Factor D, "Tenor of Relationship"; and Factor E, "Attitude." Analysis of variance, carried out on each of the 5 factors, indicate clearly that race, social class, and degree of pathology affected clinical judgments. Black clients were judged more positively than white clients. Lower-class clients were viewed more negatively than upper-class clients, and the more "pathological" case was judged less favorably. Treatment implications are considered in some depth. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

KP- objectivity & deterministic thinking vs subjectivity & self-concept
KP- understanding in social work
SU- Client Characteristics; Life Experiences; Self Concept; Social Casework
AB- Considers that much social work has been undertaken on the basis of common sense, intuition, and the feeling that the client's situation has been "understood." Medical sociological, and psychological sources of theories which posit "objectivity" and deterministic ways of thinking are criticized as contrary to true understanding and not supportive of constructive attitude and professional change. It is suggested that the goal of social work should be to discipline this "understanding" based on an investigation of the meaning which people give to their world and their role in that world. This phenomenological approach emphasizes subjectivity and the role of the self-concept. It incorporates the formative influences of past experiences while asserting the primacy of the person who imposes significance on those events and his present situation. It is believed that such an approach would relate more directly to the practice and goal of social work and those concerned with social welfare.

AB- Discusses whether suicidal behavior should be prevented and how successful suicide prevention centers (both medical and volunteer) are in preventing suicide. The work of the Samaritans, an English volunteer suicide and crisis prevention organization, is described. Results of surveys of the Samaritans and their clients indicate that they have been successful in reducing suicide rates to a small but significant degree. Findings from American suicide prevention services are briefly presented and difficulties in interpreting these data are discussed. Reasons for the increase in suicide attempts in Britain are examined (e.g., the relaxation of moral norms opposing suicide and increases in anomie). It is suggested that psychological, sociological, and biological factors are all contributors to the increases in suicide attempt rates and that high-risk populations and the role of prevention efforts should be further studied.

Such clients face crises of their own (e.g., menopause and job failure) in addition to those generated by their growing teenagers. Letting go of children, and the nature of their marriage itself, are particularly bothersome at this age. Self-awareness is the primary mode for their resolution. The psychotherapist can foster this by making the destructive interaction between partners ego-alien. A case example is provided. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

SU- Drug Addiction; Drug Rehabilitation; Group Psychotherapy; Therapeutic Community
AB- Discusses the Family-a voluntary client-led and client-operated drug rehabilitation group with 65-90 members (at any one time). This group views the addict as a fixated child in an adult body. Its role is thus to train the member to recognize and relate to real people. Discipline is strict. Theoretically, the Family borrows concepts from transactional analysis, Gestalt therapy, reality therapy, E. Erikson, W. Reich, and Freud. The program is carried out through the symbolic use of a wartime battlefield game. The game teaches that an individual's accumulated rage over real and imagined injustice is both useless and a barrier to emotional growth. The game uses the confrontation of sensitivity groups and the primitive explosion of Gestalt therapy. It is reported to be effective with 85% of the members.

Each uses the patient-therapist relationship to promote growth and formulate effective help for the patient. The approaches differ in their methods of identifying the problem and in the form of the patient-therapist relationship. It is suggested that a child guidance agency whose goal is to meet community needs may experience difficulties with behaviorally oriented therapy because of the noncompliance of parents. Supportive therapy is recommended as an adjuctive treatment to a behavior modification program. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

KP- group therapy interaction chronogram
KP- recording sequential group therapy sessions & demonstrating progressive phases
SU- Group Psychotherapy; Psychotherapeutic Processes
AB- The group therapy interaction chronogram (GTIC), an heuristic device for rapidly recording sequential group therapy sessions, demonstrates the progressive phases within each session and exhibits dynamic patterns in successive sessions. It is of particular value where traditional methods of recording, e.g., the tape-recorder or use of a 1-way screen, are contraindicated. Theoretical and practical difficulties of recording content and interaction patterns are discussed, and the evolution of the GTIC from the author's individual chronogram is described. The GTIC can be used by professional staff from many disciplines to record any group session whether it is formal group psychotherapy, counseling, discussion, or case conference. A hypothetical example of a completed GTIC is given, but it is emphasized that each therapist must choose his own notation depending on the dimensions he wishes to record.

KP- theoretical & practical criteria predictors

SU- Academic Achievement Prediction; Social Work Education
AB- Attempted to discover those variables which would most effectively predict success on a 2-yr social work course. 2 intakes of students (n = 40 and 41) beginning professional polytechnic courses were administered a battery of 10 tests. It was hypothesized that (a) the predictors of theoretical and practical criteria would differ and (b) there would be a significant correlation between a reading comprehension test and the theoretical criterion. Results indicate that theoretical performance was effectively predicted by cognitive variables, but only the Nufferno Level Test, measuring ability and persistence, correlated significantly and consistently with the practical criterion. Highly significant correlations were found also between 1st- and 2nd-yr examination results and the practical criterion. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)

Discussion centered around clinical procedures, differences from traditional team approaches, and the implementation of research findings in practice. Results indicate that this intensive individualized approach was successful, especially with aggressive patients. However, gains made during the program dissipated when treatment terminated which reinforces the importance of sustained treatment for patients in this age group.

AB- Studied the psychological reactions of patients to hemodialysis treatment for chronic renal disease. 22 patients were interviewed in their homes to elicit data concerning their reactions to the disease and treatment. Findings indicate that the variable most crucial to the adjustment process was that of financial resources, followed by a dependency on family members. Other related variables found were age, sex, socioeconomic background, and severity of the disease. The emergence of a basic defense pattern among patients differing only in degree was identified. Issues requiring further clarification are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Analyzed the impact of a consciousness-raising group on its member's resocialization process. Results from 25 group sessions and interviews with 11 of the regular participants indicate that consciousness-raising sessions provided a new experience and language through which shifts in identity, self-understanding, and world view occurred. In addition, greater autonomy confidence, self-knowledge, and changes in negotiation of interpersonal relationships were reported by the participants. Group membership was instrumental in fostering shifts in member's ideals and values; group processes increased the member's sense of well-being. This group was effective for educationally and economically advantaged women; however, it is unclear as to its utility for other segments of the population.

AB- Examines problem families in which infantilization of women by their mothers coupled with absence of a normal relationship with their fathers has resulted in poor functioning and low self-esteem. The dysfunction of the mother is reinforced by extended family menbers, especially siblings, and carries over into the next generation. Treatment is usually sought for the daughter most like the mother when a crisis occurs, e.g., the death of the grandmother or the separation of the mother from the husband, and this crisis provides impetus for reorganization of the family and development of more capability and autonomy for the mother. The phases of therapy are described, and case material is used to illustrate the process by which the mother is helped to achieve some measure of autonomy.

AB- Discusses factors involved in the effective treatment of an adolescent. It is suggested that the therapist should have a working knowledge of developmental processes, adolescent psychopathology, and the patient's familial and cultural milieu. Factors essential to the development of communication in the therapeutic relationship are explored. It is considered that the therapist should be a sympathetic and empathetic listener and allow the adolescent to unburden emotionally laden material. The therapist's encouragement of the adolescent to discover herself is considered an essential ingredient conducive to psychotherapeutic gain. In the long run, this will facilitate growth and development of new strengths and capacities. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

Of those "running to," 12 ran to deviant experiences, 11 verbalized reasons for leaving, all 13 returned to court, and 9 were committed. Results indicate that girls running from family conflicts significantly benefited from family therapy, while the behavior of those seeking deviant experiences was not altered by any of the utilized methods of intervention.

Findings show that the patient, when labeled as black, was classified among the schizophrenias or borderline categories by almost all of the respondents, while the same patient, when identified as white, was most often diagnosed as obsessive compulsive. More favorable ratings were assigned to the white protocol to a significant degree (p &lt; .05).

It is maintained that this organisonic conception of man is a holistic view which articulates the practioner's image of mankind in relation to his environment and as such can be a framework for practice and education.

AB- Describes a project in which graduate social work students were assigned, as part of their field training, to private family physicians' offices. The importance of the social worker's input to the medical team is stressed. The objectives of the program were to enhance collaborative skills, improve team communication, introduce counseling as part of the physician's practice, reduce necessity for outside referrals, and sensitize team members to each other's roles and areas of expertise. It is concluded that these types of placements can be valuable to social work education, the patients served, and the family practitioner.

KP- placing antisocial & prosocial boys in same group

KP- 9-12 yr old boys in summer camp
SU- Antisocial Behavior; Behavior Problems; Peer Relations
AB- Evaluated the effects of placing antisocial and prosocial 9-12 yr old boys in mixed groups in a summer camp. 44 Ss were placed in 4 prosocial (i.e., no antisocial children) groups and 37 prosocial and 5 antisocial Ss were placed in 4 mixed groups. Antisocial behavior was defined as physical or verbal aggression toward others, object aggression, and disruptive behavior toward peers and adults. Antisocial Ss were identified from parent, referral agency, O and self ratings. 2 trained Os rated Ss' behavior during the 3-wk experimental period. Although not significant, results show that (a) there was little incidence of antisocial behavior among prosocial Ss in mixed groups (the highest frequency of antisocial behavior occurred during the 1st wk); and (b) antisocial Ss maintained a relatively constant rate of both pro- and antisocial behavior during the 3 wks. It is concluded that mixing antisocial and prosocial children does not have any significant effects on prosocial children. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Describes "ascription," a technique used in interviews which gives immediate qualitative feedback to the client about his situation. Ascriptive statements given by the interviewer help clients to reflect on themselves and improve communication between counselor and client. Implications of ascription in various social work theories are discussed. A survey of 20 tape-recorded interviews between social work instructors and a family revealed 526 ascriptions; 85% of the ascriptive statements provoked immediate responses from clients. Various kinds of ascriptive statements are considered. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

The benefits of the approach include direct contact and the opportunity for immediate communication among the consultant, consultee, and patient; a comprehensive child evaluation with the consultee participating in the final group interview and treatment plan; a strengthening of the relationship between consultee and family due to a shared learning experience from team discussion; and increased understanding of cases in a comparatively short time period. In follow-up contact, consultees expressed positive reactions in terms of consultee-patient relations, as well as the desire to utilize this method of consultation in future cases.

KP- valid minority research
SU- Experimentation; Minority Groups
AB- Reviews and critically analyzes 3 assumptions supporting the position that valid research in the area of minority concerns can only be executed by minority researchers. These assumptions are that valid minority research requires a researcher who has full membership in a minority culture; that minority affiliation is essential in order that the investigators be free of transcultural biases; and that minority status is necessary for the researcher to be accepted by the minority community. Although it is conceded that past minority research has been poor and needing revision, it is concluded that these assumptions are singularly unpersuasive. The alternative solutions offered are that more stringent controls be placed on the scientific method; that the minority community have further controls on the research; and that non-minority researchers make use of representatives from the minority community to assist in understanding certain phenomena.

SU- Social Casework; Social Workers
AB- When people seek social work help with problems in their relationships with others to whom they are very close and by whom they feel betrayed, attacked, or maltreated, the distress and force with which the problem is brought are often so great that the social worker may accept as substantially accurate the client's view of the situation and act accordingly. It is argued that this line of action may be misguided or even harmful, and that help can only be effective in the situations described if one assumes that the picture conveyed of "the absent 3rd person" has more connection with the client's own inner needs than with anyone else.

AB- Describes a volunteer case aide program started in 1963 in a psychiatric setting to utilize the talents of mature community volunteers to work in a direct personal, 1-to-1 relationship with the mentally ill and/or emotionally disturbed. Through the program, the community has been brought into closer cooperation with the hospital. Volunteers and part-time psychiatric social workers have helped diminish the manpower shortage in the mental health field, relieve the chronicity of many patients, and move patients into community placements. The associate leader training program through its weekly training meetings, gives the experienced volunteer the responsibility of teaching the beginning case aide to understand his own role with the patient, relate effectively with the patient, and learn about the hospital operations, treatment modalities, and pertinent psychiatric and social theories. New volunteer groups under the associate leaders' guidance have proven to be effective instruments for the expanded teaching and service aspects of the case aide program.

SU- Group Dynamics; Self Perception; Sensitivity Training; Social Casework; Social Workers
AB- Suggests that T groups might be of value in social-work training as a means of encouraging social workers to make greater use of group techniques. T groups have been criticized on ethical grounds and for their tendency to produce psychological disturbance in predisposed individuals. In the context of social-work training, T groups have the dual function of promoting self-awareness in the participants and increasing their knowledge of group dynamics. A procedure is described which emphasizes the necessity of focusing on group behavior, as opposed to individual psychopathology. It is argued that this procedure would reduce the psychological hazards. A brief outline is given of the manner in which material produced in the group sessions may illustrate theoretical material introduced elsewhere in the training course. (15 ref.)

AB- As part of a longitudinal investigation of the development of all children born in Britain in 1 wk of 1958, the characteristics of motherlessness among 237 11-yr-olds living with their natural fathers were examined. Interviews with fathers or other adults show that 1/2 of the cases of motherlessness were caused by marital breakdown and 1/2 by the mother's death. Families in which the mother was missing tended to be smaller than intact families and to contain a higher proportion from lower social class backgrounds. Two-fifths of the children concerned were being cared for by their father alone. One child in 3 had a stepmother, with remarriage being more common among younger fathers. Comparative data from the larger study indicate that children who had lost their mother by the age of 11 were less likely to be living in a 1-parent family than those who had lost their father.

KP- outreach project emphasizing concern with clients' personal crises & social competence development
KP- indigenous paraprofessionals within multiservice framework
SU- Mental Health Personnel; Mental Health Programs; Paraprofessional Personnel
AB- 602 out of a total of 5,000 outreach cases, seen within 1 year, were reviewed to evaluate an outreach project in New York City staffed by indigenous paraprofessionals within a multiservice center framework. The project provided the indigenous worker a chance for greater upward mobility. Unlike the focus of the welfare staff concentrating on eligibility for assistance, these outreach workers concerned themselves with the client's personal crisis, and developing social competence. The overall evaluation was a positive one, establishing the project as an agent for the community. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

SU- Communes; Family Therapy
AB- Describes treatment of a couple and their child who lived in a communal setting catering to runaways. Treatment took place at Clinic of Children's Psychiatric Hospital, University of Michigan Medical Center. The initial presenting problem was sudden incorrigibility of the couple's son. The couple was suspicious of the traditional approach of the Clinic and often intellectualized their family problems. An attempt was made to overcome fear of establishing a therapeutic alliance. During therapy the couple realized the communal relationships were not working, that the commune was a tool to avoid intimacy, and that to achieve independence they would have to move back to their own home. Throughout treatment the couple was dealing with environmental changes, role conflicts in their relationship, internal struggles, and movement towards maturity.

KP- readoption from 1 family to another
KP- emotionally deprived child
SU- Adoption (Child); Case Report; Emotional Disturbances
AB- Readoption became necessary in a case where an emotionally deprived child was placed with a couple unable to cope with the situation. The youngster's natural mother was unwed and had kept the child for 15 mo prior to placing him for adoption. He was catatonic, passive, and moody, placing a strain on the adoptive parents and their children. Therefore it became necessary to change the placement; however, transition was gradual. Preliminary meetings among the 2 families and the child paved the way for eventual success. The original placement was not viewed as a failure but rather an opportunity to ease the guilt of the original adoptive parents and make a smooth adjustment for the adopted child into his new home.

SU- Attitude Change; Culture Change; Parent Child Relations; Social Values
AB- 3 culturally related changes in adult attitudes toward children and youth were explored. Achievement orientation in child rearing and education, and the new emancipation of parents have prompted new demands on children for intellectual and emotional independence. A 3rd factor affecting adults through their child is loss of faith in reason, science, and technology to promote human progress. Emphasis on the uniqueness and homogeneity of youth and the discrepancy between what adults and children believe were cited as examples of how adults misinterpret the effect of social changes on their children. Such changes were mentioned as potential source of conflict. It was recommended that professionals acknowledge the problem, educate parents about responsibilities evolving from their new personal freedoms and that they be aware of the social pressures on parent-child difficulties.

It is concluded that high therapist motivation, defined time limits, and informal milieu were influencing factors. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

Children in the center and natural parents saw each other more frequently and parents had a wider range of involvement than did those in the control groups.

Particular emphasis is placed on the importance of including the divorced or separated father because there seems to be a special reluctance to go beyond the symbol of finality into existing roles and ties.

KP- social conflict
KP- implications for casework practice
SU- Conflict; Social Casework
AB- Examines the concept of social conflict in terms of its usefulness in refining and extending social casework theory. The influence of the homeostatic approach to casework practice vs. an approach utilizing a conflict orientation is noted. L. Coser's sociological theory of conflict is emphasized in an effort to discover heuristic concepts applicable to the practice of social casework. Specifically, 7 of Coser's original 16 propositions related to conflict theory were analyzed. It is concluded that a conflict orientation would serve to clarify the functional aspects of conflict as they relate to the dyadic casework relationship. (22 ref.)

Results show significant differences between the 3 groups and tend to support predictions that certain resident behaviors would reflect differences in the physical design and staff role in the homes.

KP- human interactions & reactions at crisis-point of admission into residential care
SU- Hospital Admission; Residential Care Institutions
AB- Most separate social work agencies used to have, or still do have, clients entering specific forms of residential care. Since the reorganization of the social services, a local authority social worker is likely to meet a much wider range of people requiring periods of care away from home. Some generic aspects of reception into residential care are considered. Human interactions and reactions at the crisis-point of admission are discussed, and ways are suggested to ease the impact of admission for all parties, especially for the new entrant. It is concluded that if some of these suggestions sound incongruous when applied to penal institutions, then it is debatable whether such places can provide helpful care. (30 ref.)

AB- Conducted a group counseling project for misdemeanants in a county workhouse in an attempt to reduce recidivism. The original group of 11 18-31 yr. old males was given intensive prerelease group counseling, intensive postdischarge follow-up, and continuing community services. The entire group maintained contact with the project staff for at least 6 mo. Compared to a matched group of misdemeanants, they committed fewer total offenses and had a much lower rate of serious felonies in the follow-up period. During the 1st 2 yr., 133 individuals participated in 1 or more group sessions including misdemeanants, former offenders, nonoffenders, and wives and girl friends of group members. Program development and expansion and the use of indigenous former offenders as paraprofessionals are described and discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Reviewed 61 articles on the use of groups by social workers. Results indicate an underutilization of group potential and the imposition of worker goals when other needs were in evidence. The majority of the groups were treatment oriented, aimed for personal growth, and used discussion as the sole interaction. Few articles indicated any recognition or utilization of the group processes, considered members' perceptions of the group purpose, or discussed conflicts between the members' and workers' goals. When divergence of goals was noted, it tended to revolve around the worker's desire for therapeutic goals and the members' desire for environmental change. Articles concerning group work with welfare recipients, unwed mothers, the aged, and tenants are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

SU- Drug Abuse; Drug Rehabilitation; Heroin; Heroin Addiction
AB- Briefly considers the pharmacological characteristics of heroin, its history of usage, and its properties in the "drug culture." The history of the social response to heroin in the United States is traced from the mid-1800s with emphasis on legal and medical policies. Estimates are presented of the number of heroin addicts, and the social costs in the areas of individual rights, crime, and alienation are discussed. It is proposed that the drug problem is one of abuse rather than use. It is suggested that (a) the penalties for possession of small quantities of drugs for personal use be removed, (b) marihuana be legalized with controls such as those for alcohol, and (c) community drug centers be opened where heroin would be available at little or no cost for both addicts and nonaddicts. The inclusion of nonaddicts is considered as a method for establishing a climate of prevention through the provision of information and motivational feedback in a nonthreatening atmosphere.

SU- Drug Usage; Marijuana Usage; Narcotic Drugs; Personality Disorders
AB- Identified illicit-drug users among the girls admitted to a remand home over a 2-yr period. 194 of 1,088 Ss had used cannabis or amphetamines prior to admission and a further 33 had used narcotics. These and 100 matched control admissions were studied for a subsequent 3-yr period with results indicating that 40 soft-drug users (but only 1 control) had progressed to hard-drug or narcotic use. 90 Ss were selected for further detailed follow-up and divided into 3 groups: those who were taking narcotics on admission, progressor, and nonprogressor groups. The items which most significantly distinguished the 3 groups were those relating to prior personality abnormalities, prior psychiatric referral, and difficulty in relating to peers and to adults. It is suggested that these differences are of prognostic importance and may aid early identification of soft-drug users most vulnerable to progression to narcotics. (18 ref.)

AB- Reports findings on the depressed woman's performance as a mother to her adolescent children during her illness and recovery. The social functioning of 40 25-60 yr. old women was compared with that of a group of nonsymptomatic controls. Clinical data on the mother-child interaction were obtained in the course of the psychiatric or casework treatment. Information on the adolescents of the control group was obtained during the mother's research assessments. A high degree of impaired communication, resentment, disaffection, and hostility was observed in the depressed mothers toward their adolescent children. After 8 mo. of treatment for depression, their parental performance had improved considerably in all areas. However, Ss were still somewhat more impaired than the controls, especially in their ability to communicate with their children. (21 ref.)

SU- Demographic Characteristics; Hot Line Services; Loneliness; Social Isolation; Widows
AB- Describes a project in a large urban area aimed at providing mutual help for the widowed through a "hot line." Data from records of 570 calls received during an 8 mo. period indicate that approximately 73% of the callers were experiencing loneliness and isolation. Callers were generally women (90%), ranged in age from 24-90 (modal age 51-60), and had been widowed in the last 2 yr. (46%). Younger callers were more likely to be seeking new relationships, while older Ss were more likely to be seeking a listener. While the majority of Ss (61%) were unemployed, employment did not reduce loneliness: 50% of those employed full time asked for aid in making new friends. Widowers were more likely to want to make new friends and less likely to ask for practical information unless they had young children at home. Additional findings indicate that finances were not regarded as a major problem and that professionals (clergy and others) had offered little assistance to the bereaved. Actions taken by the volunteers are noted. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

Although total abandonment of biracial adoption is not advocated, it is concluded that in this society only black families can assure an environment in which there is optimal opportunity for growth, development, and identification.

KP- ideologies of need
KP- social work department organization
SU- Social Casework
AB- Explains variations between Scottish social work departments regarding the way in which clients and professionals are mutually allocated for service provision. Through the analysis of semistructured interviews and observational data, a framework is generated for the conduct of further comparative research. The material presented suggests that in order to understand the organizational procedures of a social work department it is important to pay particular attention to the sets of meanings (ideologies) which professional social workers themselves assign to their work and the organization of which they are a part. An account of the organizational procedures in social work is seen to entail an account of professional ideologies about social need. The data indicate that need-ideologies are multidimensional in character and may be distinguished in terms of the unit, and assessor of need. It is suggested that the allocation procedures current in social work departments may be seen as attempts, varying in degrees of success, to implement a number of need-ideologies at the operational level.

KP- social class & similarity to own child's maladaptive behavior
KP- treatment-seeking attitude
KP- parents of problem vs. normal children
SU- Behavior Disorders; Parental Attitudes; Social Class
AB- 200 parents gave their views in a structured open-ended questionnaire. 77 parents admitted to having a child who behaved maladaptively. These parents were the "problem" group, and the remaining were regarded as the "normal" group. It was found, at a statistically significant level, that parents in the "problem" group would tend to avoid seeking help if their child had the problem under discussion. Yet these same parents would advise treatment of a child with a different type of maladaptive problem. It is suggested that this inconsistent response indicates the operation of ego defense mechanisms. Social class variation had less effect upon parents' attitudes than had been expected. (27 ref.)

KP- social worker's interview with 75 yr. old mother of mongoloid
SU- Case Report; Down's Syndrome; Parent Child Relations; Social Casework
AB- Presents the transcript of an interview introduced by the author (See PA: Vol. 49 Issue 3), a probation officer-psychiatric social worker, with the 75-yr-old mother of her 33-yr-old mongoloid daughter. Details of the daughter's behavior, and the feelings and reactions of the mother and others are included. Experiences with social workers, the decision to place the daughter in a training center, and extenuating circumstances surrounding the mother's probation for working while receiving public assistance are described. The mother expresses bitterness and cynicism toward people who ridiculed and toward social workers. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)

KP- racism

SU- Racial and Ethnic Differences; Racism; Social Casework
AB- Examines the implications of racism in the therapeutic relationship between a minority client and white worker. The contention is stressed that common background is less important than many claim and that special training can help compensate for differences between worker and client. Early in their training, social workers learn to subject themselves to critical self-examination with regard to their feelings toward clients. To overcome the blocks to interracial worker-client relationships, they must use this technique to examine how their racial attitudes affect their work with minority clients. Only then will they reach their professional goal of serving all clients effectively. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

Reactions including anger, guilt, and anxiety are considered, as are the effects on the family. Guidelines are presented to assist social workers in evaluating and counseling mourning parents, consulting with medical and nursing colleagues, and attaining personal mastery of this work.

AB- Discusses the environmental, economic, and cultural stresses and the powerlessness that exist in the black communities of most major American cities. These factors point to the social milieu, not the individual, as the subject for change and, therefore, they are germane to the goals of mental health programs in black communities. Although helping community residents increase their capacity to solve their own problems is a legitimate goal of any community mental health program, helping reduce preventable stress in the community is considered equally legitimate.

KP- social worker-client racial difference
KP- casework relationship
SU- Clients; Racial and Ethnic Differences; Social Casework; Social Workers
AB- Discusses findings on the subject of whether racial differences between the social worker and client create insurmountable obstacles to the casework relationship. Although nonwhite workers may be necessary for nonwhite clients in some instances and therapeutically desirable in others, it is concluded that white workers can and have worked effectively with nonwhite clients. Although race is considered to be important, the nature of the interpersonal relationship established between 2 people is more important than skin color, and although there are disadvantages to racially mixed worker-client contacts, there are special advantages. Conversely, there are special advantages to racial similarity and there are countervailing disadvantages, i.e., each encounter presents a unique situation. Differences in sex, age, and political and personal ideologies are considered as well as race. To talk in terms of white and nonwhite is to simplify dichotomously a variegated situation that includes many kinds of whites and nonwhites.

SU- Case Report; Drug Addiction; Drug Rehabilitation
AB- Presents the case history and describes the therapy of a young drug addict to illustrate the possibility of achieving significant change in an addict while he is still using drugs. The rehabilitation process is divided into 3 stages: (a) establishing a stable drug dosage for the S and reorganizing his social situation so that it does not work against therapy attempts; (b) weaning the S from drugs, either suddenly or gradually; and (c) lending help and support as the S learns to cope with new stresses when he returns to society in the new role of a "normal person" and "nonaddict." In retrospect, 3 important points of the S's therapy were noted: the staff's acceptance of him, achievement of significant change while S was still on drugs, and work with the S's family.

SU- Child Guidance Clinics; Client Characteristics; Family Size; Social Casework; Social Class
AB- Examined the effects of an appointment system on client convenience and client preferences of appointments in an educational child guidance center. 11 hypotheses were formulated. A consecutive sample of 100 new and ongoing cases was analyzed in relation to the following variables: (a) social class, (b) number of children in the family, (c) presence of preschool children, and (d) mother working. It was found that of the appointments kept, 29% of new cases and 24% of the ongoing cases felt inconvenienced; 30% of the sample would prefer to be seen on the weekend; and, of the 30% who wanted an evening appointment, weekdays were preferred. The main factors which influenced these choices were social class, mother working, and father's availability. It is apparent that there are definite preferences for days and times which are not always in keeping with agency practice. This has direct implications for the provision of social work help at least for the area studied and perhaps for social service departments in general.

Patterns of living which are unique to  Mexican-Americans are described and special attention is given to communication, attitudes toward the law, influence of religion, role of the male, and the significance of the extended family. How social work method was adapted to provide effective counseling and achieve agency-client partnership is illustrated through a case example of a Mexican-American family with marital as well as legal difficulties.

AB- Reports a study of mothers of 25 autistic children showing they were the victims of psychic over-determination. It is suggested that the treatment of the mother should parallel the treatment of the child. Just as the child needs to develop, so the mother needs to build her own identity, her knowledge of herself, her capacities, and her abilities. Insight is a distant goal, and for most mothers it may be neither obtainable nor desirable. Improvements in self-esteem, self-observation, and in relationships with others, including the atypical child, are suggested as feasible goals.

KP- black power movement & community control

SU- Black Power Movement; Social Casework
AB- Explores issues involved in the contemporary liberation struggles of black people, examines components of the black agenda for action, and identifies some areas of potential conflict. The choice between separatism and integration, as traditionally viewed by whites, is not a principal issue at hand since these concepts represent strategies rather than ends in themselves. An understanding of certain decisive issues related to community control can help social workers, community planners, and other environmental interventionists come to grips with primary problems affecting any potential work in areas populated by blacks and other ethnic minorities. It is pointed out that the black movement toward self-determination and community control has unleashed strong countervailing forces among the upward-climbing poor whites who have emerged into the marginal middle class. Social workers need to reorient their work and retool their practice to conform to the needs, aspirations, and directions of black people and the other ethnic minorities they serve. Specific suggestions for black as well as white social workers are included. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

SU- Adoption (Child); Adoptive Parents
AB- Describes a 4-mo adoption project using innovative techniques for hard-to-place children. 113 applicants were randomly assigned to the regular department and 85 to the project. No initial telephone interviews were conducted with project applicants: those who expressed interest were invited to the agency for group or individual meetings. Applicants were shown pictures of children awaiting adoption, given information about the project, and a description of the adoption process. Applicants who expressed an interest in any of the children were then interviewed and discussed with the worker the child's needs and his probable impact on the family. The project succeeded in placing 19 children with 17 families; the department placed 32 children. The project was more successful in transracial and older children (over 1 yr. of age) placements. Results indicate that the project applicants' participation in the decision-making process was beneficial to the placement of older children. The family characteristics, the quality of placements, and applicant and project team reactions are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

KP- social worker stability & experience & training & caseload size & intensity of family contact

KP- children placed in foster care agencies
SU- Foster Children; Social Casework; Social Workers
AB- Reports the 1st-yr findings of a 5-yr study on some of the basic assumptions of social work using 624 children placed in foster care agencies. Worker stability, size of caseload, workers' training and experience, and the intensity of attention to the family were examined in relation to the outcomes for the children: (a) discharge to improved family, (b) stable long-term placement, (c) discharge to unchanged family situation, and (d) unstable long-term placement. The stable experienced social workers with low caseloads who were able to work intensively with the children and families had a significant effect in placing the children in a stable environment. Only 1 variable, intensity of contact, had any effect on family improvement. The relationship between caseload and outcome was bimodal: the proportion of children discharged home was highest for those with the lowest and highest caseloads. Findings tend to support and to qualify the basic assumptions of social work. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

The program described was an outreach approach of taking the service to the people. Only 1 of the 8 groups was conducted within the agency. The others were in churches, community centers, state agencies, and institutions. Lines of communication were opened between neighborhood residents and the power structure and resulted in improved utility services, health clinics, and day care centers.

SU- Management; Mental Health; Models; Organizational Structure
AB- With an increasing number of mental health professionals working in a wide variety of community and social welfare organizations, the author sees an increased need for concepts from organizational theory. In historical perspective, some of the main trends in the literature are reviewed concerning organizational and management models that are unfamiliar to most clinically oriented mental health professionals. In order to develop a set of tentative action concepts consistent with the complexity of mental health tasks now being undertaken, a variety of helping interventions to these models are given. Some principles that delineate the linkages between this mixture of models and concepts are proposed. (51 ref.) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

A new administrative model is proposed which incorporates some aspects of the functional model into the traditional territorial model.

The therapist must be aware of his own value dilemma as well as that of his patients. In working with adolescents, the therapist must be particularly careful to determine what a given value judgment means to a particular individual. 2 cases are cited in which young men opposed the Vietnam war for very different underlying reasons.

AB- Compared the effectiveness of discussion and activity group approaches in changing the child-rearing attitudes and practices of 52 lower-class mothers of preschool children. Ss were given the Parental Attitude Research Instrument and Radin and Sonquist's Cognitive Home Environment Scale before and after participation in the 1-yr program. It was found that both approaches were effective in attaining program goals. Ss showed significant improvement in adopting attitudes although no differences were found in mean IQ gain for children of participants and 13 control mothers. Reduction of racial prejudice and other unexpected side effects of the program are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Correlated certain objective characteristics of foster parents and children with success or failure of the child's 1st foster home placement. The sample consisted of 157 families with foster children aged 6 yr. and older. Data included the child's sex, date of placement, and scores on the WISC or WAIS, and foster parents' religion, occupation, and reasons for wanting a foster child. Results indicate that successful placements (i.e., those that had survived 2 or more years) were related to several interacting factors, including (a) older age of the parents, (b) presence of other foster or natural children, and (c) parents' general interest in helping a child. Prediction tables of success with various combinations of characteristics are presented. (27 ref.) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

Findings indicate that Ss are greatly influenced by the nature of conceptual material used to develop understanding of a client. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

SU- Behavior Therapy; Genital Disorders; Phobias; Social Casework
AB- Argues "that recent developments in behaviour therapy demand a much more radical revision of the role of the psychiatric social worker in a behavioural modification team." The author has been a member of a behavior therapy team which includes a psychiatrist and 2 psychologists. This team has had "a special interest in the use of behaviour therapy to treat patients with phobic and sexual disorders . . . . " The use of the patient's relatives and other key figures in the treatment of maladaptive behavior is discussed. Also discussed is the history of behavior therapy from the generalization gradient, stimulus generalization, and resistance to extinction to the more recent model of transfer and persistence of behavior using concepts of stimulus and response classes. Case histories are presented to illustrate that stimuli linked by social training are not easily seen "when examining the idiosyncratic and unexpected relationships between stimuli controlling either phobic behaviour or sexual behaviour in patients with personal problems . . . . Behaviour therapy requires the selection of a training procedure which will generate adaptive behaviour that will fit into the individual's social environment so that it will be reinforced." The 3 strategies that have been suggested to accomplish this are discussed. It is concluded that it is clear "that social workers can play an important professional role in present behavioural programmes." (29 ref.)

AB- Reports on a study "designed to investigate -a= the material needs and changes in the way of life of those who become chronically dependent on a machine for life or essential bodily function . . . . -b= the reactions and attitudes of individuals to their disability and dependence . . . . -and c= the type and extent of material and emotional help, currently available or desirable, for the patients" during adjustment to their disability and machines in the hospital, when transferred home, and during subsequent years. There were 6 Ss dependent on respiratory aids, 6 dependent on power-driven wheelchairs, and 6 on kidney machines. Data were collected by interviews. Ages, "duration of disability and of independent living, social class, marital status and number of children were analysed, followed by a consideration of the practical problems of money, gadgets, space and help." Results indicate the need for additional support in all aspects of a machine-dependent life. (21 ref.) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)

KP- multiprofessional services project for social & vocational adjustment

SU- Brain Damage; Rehabilitation; Schizophrenia; Treatment; Vocational Rehabilitation
AB- Describes an 8-yr project employing multiprofessional services designed to facilitate social and vocational adjustment of 79 17-22 yr. Olds who were receiving inpatient psychiatric treatment at the time of referral. 90% of the patients were diagnosed as schizophrenic by the referring source. Special attention was given to (a) differentiating patients in whom organic brain damage was a factor, (b) transition points in treatment, (c) flexible use of assignment to a community-based therapeutic workshop, and (d) identifying maturational problems. Caseworkers were seen as coordinating the various services on behalf of individual patients as well as offering direct services to the patient and family. The outcomes of the project were rated by a caseworker who was not on the project staff, according to a 6-point scale. 62% of the patients were in the 3 more favorable categories. Education and iq were found to be significant in predicting outcomes. Positive motivation was apparently not an essential factor in predicting outcome.

SU- Collective Behavior; Communities; Institutionalization; Social Interaction; Social Isolation
AB- The quality of care offered in institutions for older adults often accelerates, rather than reduces, the threat of cultural isolation and social rejection. When institutional personnel discourage the extension of the outside community into the institution, residents and patients may react with apathy and hopelessness. Group work should provide older participants with leisure-time pursuits to help them assume personally satisfying life roles. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

The poor have never had any options from which they could make a choice. When they are offered full participation in the choice of specific services and in the evaluation of the results of these services, they will not only accept but cooperate in and profit from these services. 3 case illustrations are presented.

SU- Drug Usage
AB- Drug abuse has often been viewed within the single frame of reference of "heroin-street" addiction. This study attempts to broaden this criminal model by describing a drug-abusing population largely unknown to law enforcement personnel the "nonnarcotic" drug abusers. Using data drawn from a study of 10 such persons, a profile of this group is presented. In contrast with the heroin addict, criminal activities are almost nonexistent and drugs are obtained from legal sources. This group is therefore hidden from detection by law enforcement personnel. It is noted that 90% of the nonnarcotic drug abusers became addicted to the barbiturates and sedative-like drugs. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Investigated the association between persistence of mourning in 26 foster children and the foster mother's level of functioning. Findings strongly suggest that the foster mother's functioning affects the child's manner of coping with grief and his interpersonal relationships. Children living with the "need-bestowing" foster mothers were less expressive of feelings about loss, especially anger, more passive and submissive in their interpersonal relationships, and less invested in school and family tasks. Fantasies of these children revealed that they were less able to cope with feelings about loss and more prone to feel depression, incompetence, and a sense of rage.

AB- Attempted to relate the attitudes of 6 mental health social workers to the emergency psychiatric situation. 5 hypotheses were tested concerning comparisons of professionally trained vs. Nontrained personnel: number of statutory admissions, compulsory admissions, sex of officer, perception of the situation as therapeutic, and motives toward working in the field of mental health. Data consisted of departmental records and subjective interviews with ss. Results indicate that social workers disliked the emergency situation, exaggerated the number of such situations, did not view them as casework, and that many family crises remained unsolved. Findings are discussed in the light of crisis intervention theory which might enable the caseworker to view the psychiatric emergency situation as potentially therapeutic for the client and his family.

AB- Crisis oriented planned short-term treatment has demonstrated that most people have far greater reserves than those traditionally ascribed to them. An honest and direct approach coupled with genuine warmth and a desire to help is ego-syntonic for those persons whose disturbances result from basic communicational anomalies.

Major emphasis is on universal psychological tasks that become critical during transitional periods in the family's life cycle. In the family system, the individual's development is conditioned not only by his own biopsychological needs and motives but also by the needs and motives of the other family members and by the needs of the family as a whole.

KP- white racism & collective preconscious
KP- Mexican-Americans
SU- Consciousness States; Ethnology; Prejudice; Stereotyped Attitudes
AB- Focuses on individual and institutional racism resulting from stereotyping. This racism might be considered unintentional, disguised, and on a preconscious level. The concept of the collective preconscious is developed as contributing to white racism which apprears to be passed on from generation to generation. Examples of the media's portrayal of mexican-americans are presented to demonstrate how the media may unintentionally be contributing to white racism through stereotyping. 3 approaches to combating racism are suggested: (a) ethnic minority students and faculty can help make social work more conscious of racism in and out of the profession, (b) social work can use social action to try to influence those forces that become part of the racial preconscious, and (c) more research can be done in understanding the impact of white racism on minority group children.

SU- Community Services; Mental Health; Psychiatric Patients; Rehabilitation; Treatment
AB- Describes a program in which the community, state mental hospitals, and a community mental health center cooperate in providing an environment conducive to the continued well-being of chronic mental patients discharged from state hospitals. Data are presented from 64 female and 36 male patients who had been hospitalized for a mean duration of 9.1 yr., and were predominately schizophrenic and unmarried. Day care facilities were located as close as possible to Ss' place of residence. The Ss' self-government council determined and implemented programs for individuals and groups of patients. Activities involved learning social, interaction, and occupational skills. Individual and group counseling facilities are described, and problems of Ss living in the community are noted. Evaluation of the program after 3 yr. indicates (a) a 9% recidivism rate after 18 mo., (b) yearly costs of approximately 1/3 that required for state hospitalization, and (c) reduction in the amount of medication required for 63% of the Ss.

AB- Describes a multimodality treatment program for narcotic addicts which is primarily geared to the goal of abstinence. The psychotherapeutic continuum serves to help those addicts who can benefit at a particular level and to screen those in need of more intensive treatment. Treatment includes inpatient or ambulatory detoxification, low-dose methadone, high-level variable dose methadone maintenance, and residential center living with methadone maintenance. Each level is described and a case example presented to illustrate various principles. It is concluded that such a multimodality approach makes a definite contribution to the rehabilitation of addicts who might not otherwise be reached by more limited programs.

SU- Graduate Students; Language; Philosophies; Social Casework
AB- In order to determine whether social work, as a distinct body of knowledge, may be assisted in changing some of its basic concepts through the use of philosophy, a year-long tutorial project was undertaken. Both remedial and substantive aid was given to a selected group of 7 students working in graduate programs in social work. The focal areas were: (a) difficulty in understanding the genesis of abstract psychological terminology; (b) confusion as to how theoretical concepts relate to an analysis of psychological disorders; and (c) the general role of inference in diagnosing a psychological impairment. There were some difficulties in the students' comprehension of theoretical concepts. It was felt that some use of contemporary language philosophy can aid social work students in understanding abstract terminology. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

KP- teaching parents use of behavioral methods
KP- parents of children exhibiting acting out & aggressive & hyperkinetic behavior
SU- Aggressive Behavior; Behavior Problems; Behavior Therapy; Mental Disorders; Parent Child Relations
AB- The Cleveland Child Guidance Center set up a Child Management Group which used a didactic approach emphasizing social learning and reinforcement theory. 4 sets of parents whose children were exhibiting acting-out, aggressive, or hyperkinetic behavior were selected to participate in a 10-wk "course." 2 therapists, a psychologist and a caseworker, led the sessions. Analysis of the parents' responses to the evaluation forms, aimed at understanding of their expectation and the degree to which the group met their needs, and the therapists' view of these families and treatment course showed that behavioral methods did not complete the treatment program for the families. The children felt they were being manipulated and the object of a study. The project appeared to have limited success with children and families and to provide a basis for further therapy. Behavioral techniques are an additional tool for use with distressed children and families but do not replace discussion, play techniques, and counseling.

AB- Although it represents a small, wealthy district with funds, personnel, and leisure to develop programs, the experiences of the Orange School System in a pilot study are relevant to the widespread crisis in schools today. Because of the study, the school district altered its approach to the unreachable, nonreferable child. It has designated funds for personnel who could be with students, talk to them, and most important, listen to them. Results showed all the children concluded the year reading on their proper 3rd grade level, higher than the national 3rd grade norm. The teacher's comments were positive concerning improved social adjustment, increased interest, effort put forth by a child, better conforming to classroom routine, better group acceptance, and lessened tension.

AB- Emotionally healthy persons can align their false belief systems with those of their relatives, friends, schoolmates, and culture mates. By employing camouflaging labels they can avoid awareness of the paranoia. All such group members are sociable healthy persons who have aligned their paranoia to that of other persons to whom they have affiliative bonds. Their group is right and outsiders are wrong. Their paranoia is nonpathological because their capacity for social relationships is intact enough for their paranoia to be group-related.

AB- Since 1965, the Verbal Interaction Project, has explored a new means of preparing 2- and 3-yr-old children of low-income families for the good school achievement vital to breaking the cycle of poverty. The method encourages dialogue between mother and child. The project is based on research evidence that a child's intellectual development is closely linked to his verbal growth and that his mother can influence his cognitive development by the amount and quality of her verbal interaction with him. Results confirmed the ability of the project to raise significantly the initially relatively low mean verbal and general IQs of these children over controls.

AB- Reports on a study to determine the effect of transfers on the mortality rate of geriatric psychiatric patients. Variables studied were age, sex, race, organic or functional diagnosis, length of hospitalization, and whether Ss were ambulatory at the time of transfer. Mortality rates were significantly higher for the transfer group (N = 144) especially for the older, nonambulatory patients than for those Ss (N = 109) who had remained in their home units. The need to establish policies that keep the Ss' interests firmly in mind and that are cognizant of the effects of environmental change, especially on the aged, is emphasized.

AB- Points out certain misconceptions contained in criticisms of behavior modification theory and practice. It is argued that the behavioral approach has been empirically demonstrated to be effective in altering problem behavior and that, because of its close ties to experimental psychology and its insistence on operational specificity and conceptual parsimony, it offers decided advantages over more traditional psychodynamic approaches. Specific issues are discussed, and it is proposed that behavioral psychology can deal adequately with all important aspects of complex human behavior.

Responses were used to classify Ss into 2 distinct groups, and a sample was selected from each for intensive interviews. Early life experiences of the adoptive couples were found to be only minimally associated with their performance as parents. The adoptive couples tended to reinforce their own disciplinary experiences as children with their adoptive child. No relationship was found between nature of infertility and performance as parents. A substantial number of the children experienced behavioral difficulties in school and home. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

SU- Defense Mechanisms; Emotions; Psychotherapeutic Processes; Social Casework
AB- A review of the social work and child psychiatry literature revealed an absence of attention to the termination phase of therapy. It is suggested that this gap reflects the social worker's defensive processes against the affects involved in termination, i.e., grief over the loss, anger at the worker for leaving, and narcissistic wounds based on disappointed expectations. 3 phases in the management of these affects are discussed: denial of the impending loss; emotional reaction and expression of sadness, hurt, and anger; and working through of these feelings. A clinical example of a 12-yr-old girl is presented, based on observations during 5 therapy sessions which point up the important aspects of the process, the client's feelings, and the worker's problems in helping the client work through to termination.

Additional data on the client's social class and race were included. Information on age, sex, and level of experience were obtained on the social workers. Findings from 170 Ss showed that socioeconomic class of the client significantly influenced caseworkers in assessment and plan for treatment. Race of the client and level of experience of the social worker were not related to assessment. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

SU- Clinics; Drug Addiction; Hospitals; Rehabilitation
AB- Describes the experiences of a drug addiction treatment clinic in a hospital setting that involved the disciplines of social work, medicine, and psychiatry. The treatment modality is based on the assumption that to reject drugs a patient must: (a) develop substitute satisfactions to be found in work and personal relationships; (b) discover outlets for pent-up emotions; (c) develop techniques to cope with day-to-day problems; (d) expand his threshold of tolerance for suffering, persevering, and delaying gratification; and (e) develop a more aggressive and self-assertive attitude. To accomplish these aims, the program emphasized a work training program to provide job skills and eventual employment. It is stressed that "in the final analysis, success in treatment must be equated with improved functioning rather than total and complete abstinence."

The control group consisted of 150 patients from the same population who were routinely hospitalized. In all except 3 of the initial 36 pilot cases, it was possible to avoid hospitalization. Tenative findings at 6-mo follow-up suggest that family crisis therapy has proved to be a more economical and less stigmatizing form of psychiatric treatment than hospitalization. Its principles are outlined, and the specific participation of the clinical social worker and his role on the crisis therapy team are described.

AB- Studied the child-rearing goals and expectations of mothers of children with learning problems in a comprehensive health clinic for culturally and economically deprived black children. The sample consisted of 15 mothers and 10 boys in each of the groups. Results showed that mothers of boys with school problems expected their children to show earlier competence in areas such as self-feeding, toilet training, and dressing. Mothers of problem children discouraged energetic activities such as climbing, jumping, and sports. These mothers were also more demonstrative physically rather than verbally concerning affection. Mothers of nonproblem children relied on verbal scolding for inappropriate behavior, while mothers of problem children relied primarily on spanking.

Findings showed both groups expressed positive views about prospects for dolls of both races, suggesting that idealizing operations of children may be uncontaminated by racial influences.

KP- programed instruction & model presentation & behavioral rehearsal & assignments
SU- Group Size; Parents; Programmed Instruction; Social Casework; Treatment
AB- Describes a series of techniques for the group treatment of parents that have been derived from behavioral and small-group theories. The techniques include programed instruction, model presentation, behavioral rehearsal, and behavioral assignments. This method focuses on helping parents find specific solutions for their children's behavioral and attitudinal problems. Results from a demonstration project are concluded to be sufficiently promising to encourage an expansion of the approach and exploration of the use of additional behavioral procedures to further facilitate the treatment of parents in groups.

SU- Alcoholism; Community Services; Demographic Characteristics; Social Casework
AB- Describes and evaluates the characteristics of problem drinkers, treatment services for them, and the place of the halfway house in the mosaic of helping services. Both male and female halfway houses, their admission programs, length of stay, residents' social characteristics, and therapeutic methods are examined. With regard to developments that will affect future programs of halfway houses, it is suggested that some halfway house functions may be taken over by other agencies, but there is 1 important frontier still to be explored; the semiprotective institution, standing halfway between the outpatient service and restrictive, more highly structured hospital-based program. It is emphasized that if cooperation between transitional halfway facilities and official establishments is to be achieved, halfway houses "will have to reach a new status by maintaining minimum standards of care and accepting licensing by state agencies."

AB- Describes the development of an activities program in a home for the aged. The program was designed to offset the dehumanizing aspects of life in an institution that can strip away a person's feelings of identity and independence. It is stressed that for institutions to provide more than custodial care, they must be responsible for the fulfillment of a person's potential and this demands that social workers become agents of change within the institutions.

The state of anomie is described, advantages of existential psychotherapy are cited, and the 5 most important goals of treatment are listed and discussed in detail. These goals include aiding the process of disillusionment, confronting freedom, discovering meaning in suffering, realizing the necessity of dialogue, and accepting the way of commitment. Methods by which these goals may be achieved are presented. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

SU- Emotions; Family Relations; Family; Interpersonal Interaction
AB- Children who had been in placement at least 2 yr. were interviewed. Measurements were related to the child's understanding of his status and to his well-being rated by caseworkers familiar with the child. The well-being ratings were found to be independent of the rated level of distortion in the child's description of his placement situation but to vary with his understanding of the agency function and with rated evidence of relationship confusions. This research suggests that placement of a child with a relative itself provides no insulation against the traumatic event of separation and the attendant disruption of primary relationships.

SU- Adjustment; Family Relations; Family; Interpersonal Interaction
AB- Studied the implications of preadoptive statements of 20 adopting couples about the kind of child they hoped to adopt. Using a retrospective design, couples were seen in a semistructured interview calling for responses relative to parental preadoptive preferences, the child's place in the family, and parents' relationship capabilities as observed in an interview. There was a significant relationship between capacity for object relationships and "acknowledgement of difference" as a coping mechanism. It appears that parents' capacities to relate well in a variety of situations may be a crucial index of their ability to take on adoptive parenthood.

Data suggested the workers had no clearly developed philosophy about relationships with the law. Although they may have been able to distinguish between legal and nonlegal elements of situations, need for a legal referral or consulation was not recognized as easily as need for a medical referral. Most of the workers interviewed articulated an uneasiness about their lack of legal sophistication. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Reports on a study of 5 different types of group care settings for children in Austria, Israel, Poland, and Yugoslavia, in which assumptions about intellectual, personality, and value development of group-reared children were tested. In general, group-reared children appear to show no intellectual or psychosocial deficiencies when compared with children reared at home. The group setting also seems to have the potential to change values. It is concluded that the conditions necessary for an environment conducive to change, as shown by these settings, may not be wholly acceptable to the American professional, but that he must surmount the conflict he feels.

AB- Points to the establishment of specific behavioral goals at the outset of treatment as the most efficient means for achieving objective assessment of client movement. Researchers interested in the problem of client movement may use this article as a starting point from which more objective assessment may be developed. Further investigation is suggested concerning inherent defects in the various theoretical counseling paradigms that have caused assessment of successful intervention to remain on an abstract level.

SU- Behavior Problems; Juvenile Delinquency; Personality Processes; Sex Roles
AB- Evidence of unconscious femininity and conscious masculinity were revealed by the delinquent Ss of 3 groups of 20 Caucasian adolescent males representing varying levels of delinquency. Degree of delinquency made no difference. The Franck Drawing Completion Test, the Gough Femininity Scale, semistructured interviews, and secondary data provided demographic information and sex-role profiles used in studying the relationship of delinquent acting-out to male adolescent sexual identification, based on Freud's theory of the process of identification. The importance of the father-son relationship in developing appropriate sexual identification was reinforced in the clinical and personal data.

AB- A series of studies of family life in the low-income black community showed 3 patterns of family functioning. Some families manage well and meet their children's needs. Others function marginally and children are constantly on the verge of difficulty. Still others are involved in a perpetual state of dysfunctioning. Factors likely to enhance functioning were economic viability, education of the head of the family, and having a man in the home. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Social casework as it was conceived and as it has developed is primarily a method of individualizing human need and individualizing social services. There will never be an era in which this is no longer a basic requirement. Social casework can also be a therapeutic method. There is the centrality of the helping relationship, a purposeful and consciously directed process involving the use of professional self through which growth and change in the individual can take place. Goals are the enhancement of better personal and interpersonal functioning, a strengthening of the adaptive capacity, and a greater potentiality for self-direction.

KP- needs of aged persons
SU- Geriatrics; Needs; Social Casework
AB- In a social survey of needs of 1039 aged persons, it was recognized that many asked for help with their problems. Interviewers were instructed to make referrals to a central agency. Over 11% of the group were referred for economic, health, and housing problems. Interviewers were relieved that help was requested, and interviewees were found to be more cooperative. The social context within which the S lives was made manifest and the previously static, unidimensional information became dynamic and multidimensional. Resulting research data may well be richer and more meaningful as a result of provisions of services. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Reviews selected concepts of existentialism for application to casework. The existential caseworker sees his consultee as a fellow-being engaged with him on a journey toward problem solving, growth, and higher levels of being. He experiences his client's world as if he were the client. Corrections of distortions within the inner, interpersonal, and object world are goals of the therapeutic encounter. Existentialism provides an additudinal framework within which the caseworker functions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

KP- systems theory of social interaction in casework practice

AB- Systems theory offers a framework for understanding social interaction without jeopardy to individualization. 9 characteristics of systems are discussed. The model is of potential value to casework in that it permits a value-free exploration, a linear approach to causation, opportunity for more creative methods, and better appraisal of the total environment and elements amenable to change.

AB- Studied 10 mothers referred by welfare personnel as being inadquate in child-rearing standards. The pilot project was undertaken in rural Southern Appalachia. Data were collected by interviews and psychological testing to profile general personality types. Mothers showed little behavior that could be termed regressive but rather, a massive early arrest and fixation of personality development best understood by their adaptive style and ego functioning. Treatment of these mothers would likely be arduous and long-term. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

Referrals were made by intake workers in public welfare who had been trained to look beyond requests for financial help to see the need for intervention. A review of 50 cases showed that 24 responded positively, 14 dropped out of treatment, 7 did not respond at all, and 5 received help from other sources. With accelerated casework, the presenting problem in 1/2 the cases treated was resolved within 3 mo. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- APPLIES A GAME THEORY MODEL, IN WHICH HUMAN INTERACTION IS MEDIATED BY A COMPLEX PATTERN OF RULES AND ROLE ASSIGNMENTS SO THAT PLAYERS MAY ACHIEVE "HIDDEN PAYOFFS," TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF DEVIANT HUMAN BEHAVIOR. CONCERN WITH A DOMINANCE-SUBMISSION DIMENSION IN AMERICAN CULTURE EQUATES SEEKING HELP WITH DEPENDENCY, AND SO CREATES AND MAINTAINS UNCONVENTIONAL GAME RULES FOR DEPENDENT PERSONS. IN RELATION TO THIS, THE INTERPERSONAL STRATEGIES OF INSTITUTIONALIZED MILDLY RETARDED SS TO DEAL WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL STRUCTURE, MAY DETERMINE THE LEVEL OF ABILITY DEMONSTRATED. 2 GAME EXAMPLES ARE DISCUSSED: (1) THE COURT JESTER GAME, IN WHICH THE RETARDATE AS THE "FOOL" MAY SAFELY INFLICT PAIN AND DISCOMFORT, I.E., MODICUM OF DOMINANCE OVER STAFF MEMBERS; AND (2) THE INCOMPETENCE GAME, IN WHICH PASSIVE SUBMISSION FORCES THE WORKER TO ASSUME ALL RESPONSIBILITY, AND AGAIN THE RETARDATE GAINS A SORT OF PASSIVE-DOMINANCE STATUS. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THE RULES, GAMES, AND ROLES MAY BE CHANGED, AND SOCIAL WORKERS MIGHT CONSTRUCTIVELY MOLD THE SS INTO ROLES ACCEPTED BY THE RULES OF SOCIETY.

EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT ALL PROGRAMS FOR DELINQUENCY HAVE INNATELY HIGH RATES OF 2 TYPES OF POTENTIAL FAILURE: (1) INTERNAL, SS RELEASED BY DISHONORABLE DISCHARGE; AND (2) EXTERNAL, SS HONORABLY DISCHARGED WHO REGRESS TO CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR. ON THIS BASIS, EVALUATION SHOULD BE MADE ACCORDING TO WHETHER FAILURE RATES HAVE BEEN REDUCED. HOWEVER, A MORE HUMANITARIAN TREATMENT APPROACH IS RECOMMENDED AS IT DOES NOT INCREASE THE RISK OF GREATER POTENTIAL FAILURE. (24 REF.) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

THE GENERATION OF INTENSE EMOTIONAL DISCHARGE HAS BEEN FOUND TO RELEASE ANXIETY AND FEELINGS PREVIOUSLY ENCAPSULATED IN THE CHARACTER STRUCTURE, ENCOURAGING EGO DIFFERENTIATION AND IDENTITY. TRESTMENT PROBLEMS, CLIENT EXPRESSION OF RESISTANCE, PREPARATION FOR THE INTERVIEW, AND ACTUAL INTERVIEW PROCEDURE AS WELL AS A CASE EXAMPLE, ARE PRESENTED. THIS BELATED SEPARATION EXPERIENCE EMPHASIZES REAL, RATHER THAN TRANSFERENTIAL, RESPONSES PRODUCING INTEGRATION OF FEELINGS, REASON, AND THE SELF. (16 REF.)

TYPICAL PRACTICE REVEALED NO MORE THAN 12 INTERVIEWS OVER A PERIOD OF UP TO 12 WK. AS THE NUMBER OF ANTICIPATED INTERVIEWS INCREASED, THE NUMBER OF CASES CLOSED WITHIN 1 INTERVIEW OF THAT NUMBER DECREASED, AND THE PROPORTION OF CASES FALLING BELOW THE ESTIMATED NUMBER INCREASED.

REACHING OUT TO FATHERS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE APPREHENSION OF IGNORANCE OF THE DISEASE CAN LEAD TO PATERNAL BEHAVIOR THAT IS NOT IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE PATIENT.

CAPACITY TO DEAL WITH THE PROBLEM WAS BASED ON THEIR EGO STRENGTH, AND IT WAS POSSIBLE TO PREDICT WHICH PARENTS WOULD NEED THE MOST CASEWORK SERVICE. JUDICIOUS PROVISION OF SUPPORT AND INTERVENTION ENABLED MOST FAMILIES TO ENDURE THE STRESS.

AB- CRISIS IS SEEN AS AN ENTITY DISTINCT FROM A CHRONIC CONDITION ALTHOUGH AFFECTED BY IT. CRISIS TREATMENT IS NOT A BRIEF FORM OF PSYCHOTHERAPY BUT A UNIQUE TREATMENT ADAPTED TO THE ACUTE SITUATION. AGENCY STRUCTURE DESIGNED TO TREAT CHRONIC PROBLEMS IS NOT SUITABLE FOR CRISIS INTERVENTION. CASEWORKERS MUST BE STRATEGICALLY LOCATED IN THE LIFE SPACE OF THE CLIENT AND IN PHYSICAL PROXIMITY TO THE SCENE OF CONFLICT TO GAIN FIRSTHAND KNOWLEDGE, BE READILY AVAILABLE TO THE CLIENT IN DISTRESS, AND TO OFFER TREATMENT TO OTHERS WHOSE BEHAVIOR INFLUENCES THE CLIENT. CRISIS INTERVENTION OFFERS CASEWORKERS THE OPPORTUNITY TO PERFORM AN IMPORTANT PREVENTIVE FUNCTION. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- SOCIAL WORKERS HAVE RECENTLY BEEN ACCUSED OF TURNING AWAY FROM THE POOR. IN AN EFFORT TO ANSWER QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE POOR AND THEIR SPOKESMEN, BIBLIOGRAPHIES OF 37 MEN AND 20 WOMEN CONSIDERED SOCIAL WELFARE LEADERS BETWEEN 1890-1914 WERE REVIEWED. RESULTS INDICATE THAT EARLY WORKERS SPOKE FOR THEIR OWN MIDDLE CLASS.

INTERVENTION TO RELIEVE STRESS, FOCUS ON THE SITUATION, AND DELINEATION OF PAST FROM PRESENT UNRESOLVED CONFLICTS ARE ADVOCATED TO FREE THE CHILD FROM BEING AN OBJECT OF DISPLACEMENT. CRISIS INTERVENTION CAN PREVENT FURTHER REGRESSION AND DISRUPTION OF PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS AND CAN BE A MEANINGFUL SERVICE IF IT IS GIVEN AT THE TIME IT IS REQUESTED AND NEEDED.

AB- CHARACTERISTICS OF PARTICIPANTS IN THE EDUCATION AND NEIGHBORHOOD ACTION FOR BETTER LIVING PROJECT WERE COMPARED WITH FAMILIES SEEN BY FAMILY SERVICE AGENCIES AND THOSE SEEN IN A PARENT EDUCATION PROGRAM. PROJECT PARTICIPANTS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM REGULAR ATTENDERS IN THE OTHER GROUPS AND IN FACT, DIFFERED LITTLE FROM THE NONATTENDERS AND REFUSERS IN THESE OTHER GROUPS. WITHIN THE PROJECT ITSELF FEW DIFFERENCES WERE FOUND BETWEEN REGULAR ATTENDERS AND DROPOUTS. DATA SUGGEST THAT THE PERSONS REACHED WERE MORE DEPRIVED THAN THOSE IN THE COMPARISON GROUPS, THAT THE MORE ENTERPRISING RESIDENTS IN THE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES REFUSED TO JOIN THE PROJECT, AND THAT THE PROJECT WAS SLIGHTLY LESS SUCCESSFUL IN RETAINING AS MEMBERS NEGROES, MEXICAN-AMERICANS, AND PERSONS WITH LESS THAN HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION THAN IT WAS IN RETAINING WHITE CLIENTELE AND PERSONS WITH MORE EDUCATION.

AB- STUDY OF INDIVIDUAL AND JOINT INTERVIEWS WITH MARITAL PARTNERS SHOWED CASEWORKERS FAIL TO USE TECHNIQUES EMPHASIZED IN THE LITERATURE FOR JOINT INTERVIEWS. WORKERS SOMETIMES FAILED TO RECOGNIZE CONTRAINDICATIONS FOR TREATMENT, TO DEFINE FOCUS, USE REFLECTIVE DISCUSSION, AND USE THE INTERVIEW ITSELF TO OBSERVE TRANSACTIONS AND POINT OUT INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR AND ITS SIGNIFICANCE. DIFFERENCES IN COMMUNICATION PATTERNS WERE OBSERVED BETWEEN HUSBANDS AND WIVES. HUSBANDS PARTICIPATED LESS ACTIVELY, WERE ORIENTED MORE TO THE PRESENT, EMPHASIZED EVERYDAY CONCERNS OUTSIDE THE MARRIAGE, AND CONCENTRATED LESS ON THEIR OWN BEHAVIOR. WHEN SEXUAL PROBLEMS WERE INTRODUCED, HUSBANDS, IN INDIVIDUAL INTERVIEWS, DISCUSSED THESE MORE INTENSIVELY; HOWEVER, IN JOINT INTERVIEWS, THEY CONCENTRATED LESS ON THE SUBJECT THAN DID THE WIVES.

DATA SOURCES WERE DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARIES OF SIBLING RELATIONSHIPS AND INTERVIEWS WITH FAMILIES AND CHILDREN. AREAS OF INTERACTION AMONG SIBLINGS WERE: WISHES TO BE SIMILAR OR DIFFERENT, FEELINGS OF SUPERIORITY OR INFERIORITY, DEPENDENCY OR INDEPENDENCY, SUPPORT OR DEVALUATION, RIVALRY OR JEALOUSY, SHARING, SEXUAL BEHAVIOR, AND ALLIANCES AGAINST PARENTS, PEERS, OR OUTSIDERS. FAMILY COUNSELORS SHOULD GAIN KNOWLEDGE ABOUT DYNAMICS OF THE SIBLING SUBSYSTEM AND USE THESE FOR THE CHILD'S LEARNING AND GROWTH OR FOR INTERVENTION WHEN DESTRUCTIVE ELEMENTS OCCUR. COUNSELORS SHOULD ALSO EVALUATE CHANGES IN SIBLING SUBSYSTEMS FOR THEIR EFFECT ON MARITAL AND PARENT-CHILD RELATIONSHIPS PARTICULARLY AS THEY RELATE TO THERAPEUTIC GOALS FOR THE ENTIRE FAMILY.

FAILURE TO CLARIFY MARITAL INTERACTION, DEFINE FOCUS OF TREATMENT, AND REFLECT ON THE TREATMENT PROCESS AND ITS RELATIONSHIPS WERE SEEN AS POTENTIAL PROBLEMS IN JOINT INTERVIEWING.

IT WAS FOUND THAT CHILDREN WERE ABLE TO RESOLVE OBJECT LOSS THROUGH A GRIEF PROCESS WHICH CULMINATED IN AN INVESTMENT IN NEW OBJECT RELATIONSHIPS FOLLOWING FOSTER-HOME PLACEMENT.

KP- & SOCIAL CASEWORK
SU- Psychoanalytic Theory; Social Casework
AB- CURRENTLY THERE IS MUCH DEBATE ABOUT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF PSYCHOANALYTIC THEORY IN SOCIAL WORK PRACTICE. THE 1:1 APPROACH IS CRITICIZED AS A NARROW AND LIMITED ANSWER TO PRESSING SOCIAL NEEDS. HOWEVER, FREUD'S PSYCHOANALYTIC THEORIES DO NOT SEEK TO ISOLATE MAN TOTALLY FROM SOCIETY BUT RATHER TO VIEW HIM REALISTICALLY AS A BEING HAVING ANTISOCIAL INSTINCTUAL FORCES WITHIN HIM WHICH SOCIAL PLANNING MUST RECOGNIZE AS BOTH AN INDIVIDUAL AND CULTURAL PROBLEM. PSYCHOANALYTIC THEORY IS USEFUL AND NECESSARY TO UNDERSTAND, CLARIFY, AND EFFECTIVELY AID INDIVIDUAL IRRATIONAL AND OFTEN UNCONSCIOUS IMPULSES.

KP- DELINQUENT & SELF-DESTRUCTIVE ACTS
KP- INDIVIDUAL DIAGNOSIS IN GROUP-CENTERED SOCIETYC
SU- Psychodiagnosis; Social Casework; Unconscious (Personality Factor)
AB- RESPONSE TO E. WEISBERGER (SEE 41:8). THE UNDERSTANDING OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR IS IMPOSSIBLE WITHOUT THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE UNCONSCIOUS ASPECTS OF THE HUMAN MIND. OUTWARD DELINQUENT AND SELF-DESTRUCTIVE ACTS ARE SYMPTOMATIC OF AN INNER INABILITY TO FUNCTION IN A REASONABLE MANNER. THEY SHOULD BE EVALUATED IN AN INDIVIDUAL DIAGNOSTIC WAY. THE TROUBLED PERSON MUST BE UNDERSTOOD IN HIS OWN UNIQUE TOTALITY. THERE IS A TENDENCY IN THE CURRENT GROUP-CENTERED SOCIETY TO REFUSE TO SEARCH FOR AND ACCEPT KNOWLEDGE ABOUT ONESELF BY DEPRECIATING THE UNCONSCIOUS PART OF THE MIND RESPONSIBLE FOR BEHAVIOR MOTIVATION. THIS REFUSAL CAN RESULT IN A SENSE OF HELPLESSNESS OVER INABILITY TO CONTROL OURSELVES, IRRESPONSIBILITY, AND A LOSS OF SELF-RESPECT. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN DOCTOR AND CASEWORKER CONCERNING THE PATIENT'S PROBLEM AND ITS SOLUTION WAS EXAMINED IN TERMS OF FAVORABLE OR UNFAVORABLE OUTCOME. ANALYSIS OF 96 CASES SHOWED CONSENSUS AMONG COLLABORATORS TO BE LESS IMPORTANT THAN PATIENT MOTIVATION. IN FACT, MOST CASES SHOWED PROFESSIONAL AGREEMENT. DOCTORS TENDED TO PRESCRIBE SOLUTIONS FOR THE CASES THEY REFERRED, AND CASEWORKERS USUALLY AGREED. THIS RESULTED IN MORE FAVORABLE OUTCOME THAN WHEN THE CASEWORKER QUESTIONED THE DOCTOR'S SOLUTION.

AB- WHETHER CASEWORK CAN BE SPEEDED UP AND INTENSIFIED BY IMMEDIATE SERVICE WAS TESTED OVER A 24-WK PERIOD. 176 INTERVIEWS WERE HELD. 51 FAMILIES WERE SEEN WITHIN 1-4 DAYS OF THE TIME THEY APPLIED. MARITAL AND PARENT-CHILD PROBLEMS WERE MOST PREVALENT. CRISIS INTERVENTION APPEARS TO REACH MORE PEOPLE, PARTICULARLY LOWER INCOME LEVELS, AND TO RESOLVE PROBLEMS IN LESS TIME (6-8 WK) THAN USUAL METHODS. THIS SEEMS RELATED TO PROBLEM-FOCUSED CASEWORK AT A TIME WHEN PEOPLE ARE MORE ACCESSIBLE AND LESS RESISTIVE. FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONNAIRES SENT 12 WK. AFTER THE PROJECT'S COMPLETION INDICATED FAVORABLE RESPONSE TO THIS METHOD. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

SU- Psychotherapeutic Transference; Psychotherapy; Reality Testing
AB- Therapeutic success is measured by the increased ability of patients to reality test. The treatment process is effected through interpretation and, more importantly, through manipulation of transference. Various methods wherein transference leads to reality comprehension are explored. Since casework generally can be equated with therapy, the training process of social workers should include some kind of insight-producing transaction; secondly, caseworkers should be allowed to function independently of supervisors more quickly. That means less opportunity for extensive consulation and more time for intensive therapeutic involvement with the patient. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

These syndromes and a 7-stage, empirically derived breakdown of the natural history of disasters are presented. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

The relationship must vary according to the needs of the client so that along with sympathy and encouragement room is provided for warning and discipline. The term "relationship" denotes a composite of attitudes and values which open the door to the treatment process. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- A special group of mothers, who, because of their feelings of anger and guilt concerning the death of a child, have not been amenable to casework help when they have brought a subsequent problem child to the clinic. These mothers were perceived to have established a masochistic relationship with the current problem child whereby punishment resulted in humiliation and a sense of failure. The individual's unconscious suffering is an attempt on the part of the ego to handle a punishing super-ego. A treatment plan is presented which was successful with 2 such mothers but which needs to be tested further. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

To measure the crucial problem area, the author developed the term Verbal Accessibility (VA). A long series of preceding studies are reviewed. The readiness to communicate determinant attitudes, i.e., VA, is seen to be dependent upon the interviewer's skill, motivations, and interaction with his client's characteristics.

Mutual relationships between the 2, and thence between sociology and psychoanalysis should be made. A complete set of barriers interferes and these are suggested and carefully explored. With a few exceptions, adherence to a deviant mode of behavior will be the result of a superego defect, causes lying in the nexus of child-parent relationships and of the dynamic psychology of the individual. Sociological methods can be used to test the hypotheses, but the substance of the propositions will be psychoanalytic. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

The role of being "bad" rather than "sick" is often chosen by psychiatric patients and by imprisoned offenders as it seems to offer better possibilities for coping with guilt feelings, punishment, and return to full social status. Destigmatization is necessary for a successful reversal of a deviant career after release from institutions. "Social workers aid people to profit from their deviances, to reverse the deviant career process, to perform within acceptable ranges of behavior, and provide the resources deviants need to achieve such objectives."

The malevolent child reacts with anxiety and aggression to any reactivation of his need for tenderness as it has brought painful experiences in the hostile world which surrounds him. The peer group is thus "the vital road to aiding the child." (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

Therapy was conducted in 3 overlapping phases… [by] 2 female therapists assuming grandmotherly roles and meeting the needs of parents, siblings, and child patients simultaneously.

AB- Primarily exploratory, this study documents the ready identifiability of a child's overt responses to the problem of separation during the diagnostic study. An inverse relationship is noted between the index of a separation problem and the mother's awareness of and concern about separation in her communications to the clinic. Problematic separation behavior appears to be associated with other data to the extent that overt separation behavior in the clinic is not a random event but a meaningful one. Further research in many areas is indicated; many limitations are noted in the findings of this particular study. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

If education for casework is effective, so that latent capacities of the student are challenged, the professional learning experience will be a strong inducement toward personal development. However, the agency supervisor is cautioned to avoid treating the beginning caseworker as a client in therapy. He can best help the student master for professional use the content required for practice by a sustained study of the impact of the education on the student. Thus the education can influence the likelihood that the student will constructively integrate his learning and progress toward professional maturity.

Nonmembers usually regarded alcoholism as a mental disturbance but most members defined it as "combined mental and physical illness." (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

SU- Adjustment; Attitudes; Human Migration; Parents; Urban Environments
AB- Investigated how forced moving, as part of a 1959 urban renewal project in Topeka, Kansas, affected children and their social networks. It was hypothesized that forced resettlement would have more devastating consequences for children and their families than voluntary moving. Data were collected during the 4 yrs 1961–1964, in 4 yearly interviews with each child concerning topics such as feelings about school, family, friends, moving experience, and aspirations for the future. Interviews with 31 heads of families were also conducted. The following conclusions are discussed: (a) Most children have more negative than positive feelings toward the moving process in forced resettlement, and these negative feelings occur more frequently after the move than before it. (b) Children are less likely than their parents to welcome a forced move. (c) Children who evaluated the moving process negatively are more likely to negatively evaluate their housing, school, and neighborhood after the move than children with positive evaluations of the need for moving. Suggestions are offered concerning the effects of counseling, and the time when it should occur, and the informal counseling services performed by interviewers.

SU- Housing; Nursing Homes; Organizational Structure; Social Change
AB- Discusses the structure and function of homes for the aged. In the past, such homes were characterized by custodial care, hierarchical chain of command, and routinization and standardization of events. Various recent pressures for change are analyzed: changes in characteristics of the elderly, changing values, alternatives to institutionalization, and widespread criticisms of institutions. Homes for the aged in contemporary society have adapted by expanding in size and in the services offered. This expansion is explained by (a) the cultural value of size and growth, (b) allocation of money from funding resources, and (c) reduction in cost per individual treated. Despite expansion, however, the homes of today still maintain the routinization and standardization of events that characterized them in the past, because their larger size and complexity demand bureaucratic structuring. They still do not allow for individual attention to institutionalized people. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

KP- problems associated with 'new towns' movement & social welfare concerns & future development
SU- Communities; Health Care Services; Housing; Social Integration; Urban Planning
AB- Discusses the seriousness of the 1975 collapse of the American "new towns" movement. Examples of new towns are presented that have been funded but are now in serious financial trouble (e.g., Jonathan, Minnesota and Riverton, New York), and the prediction is made that a revival of new towns should occur in the late 1970s. Three major explanations are advanced by developers of new towns for the present difficulties: (a) Housing and Urban Development pressured developers for innovations but did not support innovation research. (b) When progressive developments managed some racial integration, local institutions lessened support. (c) When developers provided social innovations such as prepaid medical group insurance, no other group was willing to help. There are optimistic predictions of revival of new towns, but 75 million new Americans will have to be accommodated by 2000 AD, and the energy crisis will demand self-contained communities; however, the pressure of these new Americans will increase creative community planning. The new town projects are ready to accept these challenges (population, energy, and land scarcity) and will be able to provide innovative solutions once welfare concerns, such as racism and poverty, cease capturing most of the attention of welfare leaders.

AB- Presents a selective overview of recent trends and directions in social research on housing in the US by focusing on interdisciplinary research emphasizing the family and the neighborhood. The principal research framework is that of physical determinism (assessing the effect of the physical setting on life-styles, attitudes, etc, or designing environments presumed to create desirable social conditions). A brief discussion is presented of the following 4 research emphases: (a) defining neighborhood and territory, (b) poverty and housing, (c) uses of space, and (d) satisfaction with housing. Four conclusions that are common to all research themes are briefly discussed: (a) The principle of physical determinism remains controversial. (b) The key research methods are observation and survey. (c) Housing research is becoming increasingly interdisciplinary. (d) American urban problems and rural nostalgia permeate the research.

AB- Discusses the Social Welfare Workers Movement (SWWM) by analyzing the Boston chapter, with the New Left theory of social change as the conceptual framework. The theory is first examined and then used to explain the development, structure, goals, activities, and demise of the chapter. It is concluded that the visions of the 1960s are not dead, but the means of promoting them is lacking. Three methods for such advancement in human service professions are suggested: changes in professional education, professional unions, and political alternatives.

KP- social work practice theories & organizational intervention & assumptions about organizations
SU- Organizational Change; Organizations; Social Casework; Theories
AB- Discusses concepts of organizational intervention and assumptions about organizations made by various theories concerning social work practice. 28 references dealing with such theories are analyzed under 4 categories: case work, group work, organizing, and social planning. Each category is considered in its relation to (a) worker involvement, (b) organizational change, (c) types of organizational theory. One of the most promising dialectical theories is that identified with the symbolic interactionist school of sociology. The applicability of this theory is examined.

KP- protective services for children & need for change in social casework
SU- Child Abuse; Social Casework
AB- Discusses protective services for children (the prevention or control of child abuse or neglect) in terms of the general picture of social casework, which is based at present on a philosophy of elitist collectivism. This philosophy supports existing institutions by the very natures of its assumptions. To make casework more human, social workers must participate actively in efforts for change. Treatment of clients must be open, negotiable, teachable, and mutually self-revealing. Both workers and clients must be involved in making policy in social agencies.

AB- Attempts to ascertain the factors associated with an organization's pattern of interorganizational relationships by interviewing personnel of a county board of public assistance (CBA) who were responsible for administering, supervising, or delivering social services. The interview concerned the frequency and purpose of interagency contact. In all, 183 contacts were content analyzed and revealed that CBA personnel had extensive contact with a wide range of agencies but only on a superficial level. These descriptive data also indicated that the primary contacts were with voluntary agencies and primarily for "service," which involved moderate interdependence between agencies. It is concluded that the CBA was a vertically oriented organization with little involvement in other organizations except the parent resource-controlling agency. Suggestions for structural solutions to interorganizational coordination are provided. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Discusses issues and problems in the area of delinquency prevention. Three views of deviance and how these perspectives influence the definition of delinquency are included. Research methods and the results of 3 types of delinquency prevention are reviewed: (a) programs for improving community life styles; (b) programs for redirecting potential delinquents by working with them before their difficulties become too serious; and (c) programs for reducing recidivism and rehabilitating delinquents, thus preventing further delinquency. Four major problems are discussed (accurate problem identification, reexamination of concepts of intervention, the role played by social control agencies, and the need to weigh the relative contributions of practitioners and researchers) that will affect the future development of prevention programs, and methods of influencing the legislative process are considered.

Primary emphasis is on the theoretical explanations relating to egoistic and anomic suicide (e.g., those offered by E. Durkheim, E. Fromm, S. Freud, and G. Groddeck). 16 specific behavioral clues for an impending suicidal attempt and 5 specific techniques of intervention are given. It is believed that sociological and psychological explanations of suicide are quite similar. (17 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

This proposition is supported by examples taken from economic, political, and social theory. (b) Social welfare exchange is a bilateral rather than a unilateral exchange, and as such is no different from other social institutions. Support is provided by a comparison of several views. (c) Perception of new self-interests provides incentives to change to a different policy. A social policy model of education, common domain, and regulatory mechanisms is presented for support. Examples are provided to illustrate the conclusion that newly perceived self-interests are a potential dynamic in egalitarian social welfare policy.

AB- Examines an identifiable maladaptive pattern of staff response when a client is seen as a very important person (VIP) in one of the societal institutions: governmental, economic, military, religious, or educational. VIP status is particularly dependent on the client's power in relation to the agency. This problem is most identifiable at time of intake, when normal agency procedures may be circumvented because of the VIP's status. There is often a failure to recognize the client as an individual, with resulting exacerbation of pathology. It is recommended that (a) the VIP phenomenon should be identified at intake, (b) underlying issues of power and status within the agency that may influence treatment of the case should be examined, and (c) normal procedures should be followed in dealing with the client.

SU- Burns; Coping Behavior; Group Discussion; Social Casework; Spouses
AB- Describes rehabilitation treatment of a group of 5 29-45 yr old severely burned patients and their spouses, with the following goals: (a) to develop a mutual support system in which members could share concerns and ways of coping; (b) to give patients at various stages of rehabilitation a time perspective, by exposure to others at different stages; and (c) to learn more about the experiences, perceptions, and coping mechanisms of severely burned patients and their spouses. In the 6 sessions leaders focused on general discussion without interpretations, helping members to see similarities and differences in their reactions to the burn experience. This pilot project indicates that a professionally led group with spouses included facilitates the arduous coping process of recovery by aiding couples to help each other. The group provided mutual support and shared perceptions in terms of family, experiences, and work, as well as providing a safe place for expression of ambivalent feelings and anger. Samples of this group process are given. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

KP- social work intervention
KP- hospitalized patients experiencing assaults to self image & changes to life style
SU- Hospitalized Patients; Personality Processes; Self Concept; Social Casework
AB- Defines 2 groups of patients in general hospitals who require special attention to the social and emotional components of their illnesses: those who experience assaults to self-image and those who must make basic changes in their life-style. These 2 groups comprise a large segment of the adult patient population found in medical and surgical services of the general hospital. The emotional reactions of patients and family members to the process of illness and its treatment by surgery and prescribed regimen are examined. Although therapeutic intervention is the shared responsibility of all health care practitioners, the social worker is particularly equipped to deal with these attitudes and reactions. Methods of social work intervention useful to both groups of patients during hospitalization are discussed. Greater utilization of therapeutic milieu concepts in medical and surgical services is urged, and the role of the social worker in fostering this is identified.

A "street corner" approach was used to motivate parents of young children with severe handicaps to participate in a workshop program dealing with practical problems of child care and with parental feelings of shame and guilt arising from the birth of a physically defective child.

AB- Maintains that conflicts in interprofessional teamwork may be as much explained by group process considerations as by the interaction of professional roles and statuses. This paper examines the interprofessional team as a small group, using a synthesis of sources from social psychology, social group work, T-group literature, management theory, and health team research. Eight issues are considered in relation to the team as a small group: (a) the individual in the group, (b) team size, (c) group norms, (d) democracy, (e) decision making and conflict resolution, (f) communication and structure, (g) leadership, and (h) group harmony and its relationship to group productivity.

AB- Confusion associated with the developmental problems of adolescence is intensified and prolonged for those suffering from sickle-cell anemia. Feelings of isolation and dependence due to a life-threatening disease can impede the transition to responsible, self-actualizing maturity. Weekly group meetings with 15-24 yr old females suffering from sickle-cell anemia helped them move toward maturation and a sense of their own competence. The experience of closeness with other adolescents who shared the same vulnerabilities was mutually facilitating. Sexual sensations and potential for family life were available counterbalances against recurrent association with pain and death. Through group support these linkages with hope were strengthened.

KP- factors contributing to successful & effective group work
SU- Group Dynamics; Organizational Structure
AB- Discusses the major factors most likely to determine the success of group work. A group is more likely to be successful if it is conducted in an organizational or institutional context in which other personnel, not directly involved with the group, nevertheless accept and support its aims and general procedures and value its potential contribution to the shared goals of the organization or institution. It is more likely to be effective if a consensus (which may be implicit) can be established about its aims and procedures. Lack of clarity, persistent splits within the group, or identification of the leader as adversary all work against the best interests of the group. Structural factors such as size, duration, composition, constancy of membership, and ratio of staff to members influence the group's character and effectiveness. A group which has lost its usefulness can and should be terminated or reconstituted with a different mandate. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)

KP- assertiveness training conducted by social work students

SU- Anxiety; Assertiveness; Social Casework; Social Workers
AB- Students at a school of social work conducted assertiveness training for 5 groups of socially anxious persons from diverse backgrounds. A total of 24 members ranging in age from 16-45 yrs included students, housewives, secretaries, an unemployed white-collar worker, a teacher, a day care supervisor, and a school principal. Treatment methods included modeling, coaching, behavior and covert rehearsal, and contingency contracts; members met weekly for 11/2-2 hrs for 8-10 wks. The major source of data was self-reported descriptions of behavior occurring outside the group. Each member had one or more behaviors that he continually monitered until satisfactory levels were achieved or failure was ascertained. Results show that, of the behaviors targeted for improvement by members, 39 were successfully treated, and 2 were not. Average number of behaviors successfully treated per person was 1.6. It is concluded that this is an effective type of program. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

KP- ego-directive therapy of limited duration
KP- application to all socioeconomic groups
SU- Brief Psychotherapy; Client Characteristics; Psychotherapeutic Techniques; Socioeconomic Status
AB- Suggests that ego-directive therapy works primarily to clarify issues on the level of ego and reality and aims at progress in ego development and at client growth in coping and adaptation. The evidence suggests that persons of lower socioeconomic status often expect and resent short-term treatment. However, illustrations abound to indicate that therapy of limited duration has a fairly wide utility, and hence its concepts should be developed and applied across all socioeconomic groups. A case history illustrates short-term therapy and how it differs from a traditional model. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

KP- parents
SU- Child Day Care; Childhood Development; Group Counseling; Nursery Schools; Parents
AB- Points out the value of group developmental counseling in a nursery school or day-care center. Because parents are inexperienced when they first have children they are then more receptive. Talking with other parents as well as teachers allows feelings to be expressed that would not emerge in conferences with teachers and school staff only. Groups encourage a parent to seek further help, if needed. This inexpensive, uncomplicated service can educate the parent in child development and provide guidelines for recognizing what behavior is normal, and what is cause for concern.

SU- Epidemiology; Syndromes
AB- Explains the Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) theoretically as a psychogenic phenomenon. Infantile apnea, which has been found to be closely associated with SIDS, is described as maladaptive, regressed behavior occurring in response to tension overload, rather than as a biologic dysfunction. Some of H. S. Sullivan's work is presented to support the concept that infants possess some ability to mediate tension and to respond differentially to environmental changes. Epidemiological findings on SIDS are highlighted, and a pattern is said to emerge which upholds the theory presented. Some of the tensions which might cause the infant to seek to recreate the paradisiacal qualities of the womb are discussed. Comments by 5 critics follow the article, and the authors reply to their criticisms. (30 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

The cost per pupil is high but may not be greater than the cost of providing separate educational facilities for these youngsters. This project is considered applicable to more children than psychoanalytic or behavior modification techniques. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Describes some personality and other characteristics of 230 male offenders in London, and relates these variables to recommendations made by probation officers, sentences passed by the courts, and the outcome of penal treatment in terms of further convictions. Probation officers were more likely to recommend probation for introverted neurotics than any other personality type, and once on probation this group was the least likely to be reconvicted. Offenders who were extraverted attracted the largest proportion of recommendations for custodial sentences, and on probation the extraverts who scored low on neuroticism were most likely to be reconvicted. A tentative explanation of the findings is offered in terms of probation "treatment success hierarchy." (20 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)

Within a 60-day cut-off period, 60 usable questionnaires were returned. Results reveal that a majority (60.9%) of the respondents approved of the use of body therapy, but less than half (44.9%) approved of the use of sex therapy. A large majority did not report using sex therapy, and only a quarter used body therapy. The importance of reevaluating the profession's theoretical and treatment values and of establishing ethical standards and review procedures is stressed.

It is suggested that an approach may be required which differs in some respects from more traditional modes of treatment. Emphasis is placed upon the need for careful observation of material facts and events in the lives of such clients in addition to careful observation of the manifestations of feelings and attitudes which may give premonition of dangerous or potentially dangerous behavior.

AB- Presents a strategy for long-term treatment of patients requiring brief but recurring hospitalizations. E. Goffman's world-building theory is used to determine if psychotic patients need brief intervention, recurring crisis intervention, or long-term intervention. The importance of the social work practice of using the patient's capacity to function during remissions as a basis for future expectations is stressed. The chronic patient develops an increasing capacity to cope with his disorder as he matures. Potential hazards of this approach are also noted.

A review of the literature indicates various theories and viewpoints regarding termination, which has been seen as a resolution of transference, as a mourning process, and as a period when internalization of newly acquired skills begins. Any useful this of post-treatment integration must enlist the participation of former patients. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

KP- idealization
KP- adolescence
SU- Adolescent Development; Idealism; Personality Development; Personality Processes; Social Perception
AB- Idealization, a regular phenomenon during adolescence, is defined as a process of attributing ideal or perfect characteristics to objects such as movie stars, heterosexual partners, or peer groups. It is utilized adaptively from infancy to latency as the individual seeks narcissistic gratifications. Preoccupied with his own ever-changing body, the adolescent increases role diffusion as his identification with the parental figures lessens. Tension reduction and resolution by methods of the least action are rationales for use of this adaptive process, while the adolescent's intrapsychic environment is in structural upheaval and society is presenting a double-bind situation to the process of identity cohesion. Idealization is an important adaptive skill used by the adolescent in his struggle to gain role autonomy, narcissistic equilibrium, and id-ego balance while reducing dependencies on parental figures. The degree of idealization indicates the degree of life adjustment, and is an important factor for therapists to consider in determining countertransference.

Effectiveness of mental health treatment in stopping law-violating behavior appeared to depend upon whether the offender habitually maintained employment and lived in a self-supporting family.

KP- talk time program in university hospital pediatric ward
KP- bedridden children
SU- Hospitals; Social Casework
AB- Discusses a "talk time" program initiated by the departments of nursing and child psychiatry at a university hospital in 1972. The social worker assigned to the inpatient pediatric service became active in the group at the end of its 1st yr and receives backup support from other members of the department. Talk time is held each weekday afternoon for 45 min in a classroom or the room of a bedridden child, and patients are encouraged to and do in fact talk about their fears and fantasies of the hospital experience. Each meeting is followed by a staff session where the proceedings are reviewed. The staff meetings have proved effective in teaching hospital personnel about pediatric patients and in helping them learn how to listen to the children's needs. It is concluded that changes in children are difficult to document, but that, certainly, when a child is allowed to discuss his fears many of his stresses are alleviated.

KP- similarities & differences in 3 residential treatment programs

SU- Juvenile Delinquency; Residential Care Institutions; Treatment Effectiveness Evaluation
AB- Collected data on 3 residential treatment programs for delinquent and delinquency-prone adolescents. Each facility housed 20-50 12-16 yr olds and had on its staff at least one person with a graduate degree in either psychology or social work. Control Ss were used in each of the 3 studies. Similarities and differences in the 3 programs are discussed. One program emerged as more successful than the other 2, and possible reasons for the difference are discussed. Nevertheless, it is concluded that generalized claims concerning the relative effectiveness of residential vs nonresidential forms of correctional treatment are premature.

AB- Conducted interviews with 30 parents who had consulted a children's hospital social service during a 5-mo period but who were no longer clients. 95% described their greatest concerns over their child as anxieties related to diagnosis, surgery, prognosis, and therapeutic regimen following discharge. In exploring their expectations of the social worker, it was found that 46% had not known what to expect and did not remember any conversation with the physician about social services. In recalling what social workers had actually done for them, 50% said they had received emotional support for their anxiety, 43% said they had been helped in finding homemakers, nursing services, and financial assistance. Only 7% did not remember that anything had been done by the social worker. 87% said that, if necessary, they would seek a social worker's help again.

AB- Illustrates planned short-term treatment with individuals, couples, and families who are struggling with maturational crises. It is noted that brief treatment can be effective with a variety of people at widely separated ends of the mental health continuum, and that resolution of crisis or mastery of stress will release natural growth tendencies. Case examples are cited. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

KP- task-centered approach to social casework 1st-yr graduate students
SU- Graduate Students; Social Casework
AB- Constructed an experiment with 16 1st-yr graduate students in social work to determine whether a task-centered approach offers a way to make casework more effective. Each S was assigned 2 cases which were randomly allocated to experimental (A) and control (B) conditions. In A cases, Ss followed guidelines for a set of interventions after developing a behavioral task designed to help reduce some aspect of a target problem he and the client had agreed to work on. In B cases, Ss followed the same procedure but refrained from giving any further assistance to the client in carrying out the task. Results show greater progress for A than for B tasks. 11 pairs of cases showed greater achievement in the A task, 3 pairs were tied, and only 2 had outcomes better for the control tasks. Findings suggest that a sequence of interventions like the one tested may be useful in mobilizing clients to carry out unique or one-time tasks.

KP- social work with hospitalized terminally ill & their families
KP- social workers
SU- Death and Dying; Hospitalized Patients; Social Casework; Social Workers; Terminally Ill Patients
AB- Proposes that social workers take advantage of the new climate of concern for the dying and reach out to help the hospitalized terminally ill and their families. Social work with the dying is conceptualized in terms of 5 basic categories: planning for living during the terminal process, exploration of feelings about impending death, living with the prospect of death, planning for death, and planning for the family after death. In addition to direct services for and with the patient and his family, value is seen in social work input to the hospital health team, including participation in the training of other staff members interested in increasing their sensitivity toward the dying.

AB- Conducted tape-recorded interviews with 963 applicants for foster children, interviewing husbands and wives separately. 145 couples, accepted as 1st-time foster parents of a 6-12 yr old child, were followed to see how they functioned. The social worker supervising each placement was interviewed at the beginning of the placement and at 6-mo intervals for 18 mos. Interviews with the foster parents were held 1, 3, and 6 mo, and at 6-mo intervals thereafter for up to 18 mo. Results show that no single characteristic of either parent was predictive of success, but when characteristics were combined by multiple correlation, the most promising and least promising applicants applicants be identified. Items considered, as a group, in predicting success were constellation in the home, social worker (time available, experience), foster child (characteristics, history), and characteristics of foster parents.

KP- adaptation of human relations training to social group work
KP- alienation
SU- Alienation; Sensitivity Training; Social Casework
AB- Notes that research on the new group approaches indicates that alienation can be combated through the teaching of empathy. It is posited that the alienated person is cut off not only from the springs of his own creativity but from groups of which he would otherwise be a part. It is felt that the person who fails to achieve a meaningful relationship with others is deprived of some part of himself. Because alienation is judged at base to be a problem in human relations, a framework for adapting the new techniques to social group work is suggested wherein here-and-now feedback is the central process and feelings, cognition, and interaction of the self and other group members are the central content of the experience.

AB- The cooperation of a county welfare department and a city area community mental health center created an alternative delivery of service for the department's clients. The need for this cooperative effort arose when the center decided it could no longer go along with what it considered an archaic medical model that was not delivering services satisfactorily. By establishing a mental health consultation unit within the department to perform Aid for the Disabled (AFD) evaluations and provide general consultation, the 2 agencies aimed to reduce the inconvenience for clients, caseworkers, and mental health professionals and have the basic decision of AFD eligibility made at the site of the problem. Although most of those involved agreed that the undertaking was carried out effectively, and costs were reduced, the program was terminated because of a definition, the qualifications of a mental health practitioner.

SU- Crises; Divorce
AB- Views the divorce process as a time of emotional crisis with some unique characteristics as well as opportunities for growth. If problem-solving mechanisms are not adequate to return the person to equilibrium, the situation is perceived as a crisis. It can be perceived as a threat, as a loss, or as a challenge. The response will differ in terms of the perception. At some point in the process of divorce, sexual identity and relationships, career choices, role models, and moral and ethical values all come up for reexamination, and the opportunity for further growth is available.

AB- Administered a 42-item questionnaire about attitudes toward women to 274 psychiatrists, residents in psychiatry, psychologists, social workers, and psychiatric nurses in 3 professional settings. Findings support the hypothesis that female therapists tend to have more contemporary attitudes toward women than male therapists but do not support the hypotheses that (a) therapists have attitudes toward women that are more traditional than contemporary or (b) social workers have more contemporary attitudes toward women than other therapists. Psychiatric nurses scored the highest number of contemporary ratings (nonsignificant). 50% of all therapists questioned held a relatively traditional stance, with males obtaining significantly higher traditional scores than women. Respondents in the social service agency showed a higher overall contemporary score than did respondents in the 2 hospitals. Reliability and validity data for the questionnaire are also included.

KP- arguments for & against adoption of black children by white parents
SU- Adoption (Child); Blacks; Parents; Racial and Ethnic Attitudes; Whites
AB- Discusses the controversy about the transracial adoption of Black children by White parents. The argument for transracial adoption appears to be based on 2 reasons: that the Black community cannot provide the needed Black adoptive parents and that raising Black children in a White home will be better than raising them in an institution or foster home. The limitations of current data on the adoption rates of Blacks by Blacks are examined, and it is suggested that the benefits of adopting a Black child at a younger age by White parents do not necessarily outweigh the disadvantages of later adoptive failures. The issue of right of choice is also discussed, and it is noted that no Black consensus has been reached on the question of Black adoption. The psychosexual needs of the child are discussed in relation to whether transracial adoption would fulfill both the child's present and future needs. It is concluded that (a) transracial adoption may harm the Black child in that he may lose his sense of Black identity and the ability to relate to other Blacks and (b) until empirical studies are made of the adult personalities of White-raised Blacks, placements of Black children should not proceed as though transracial adoption had already been found to be beneficial.

KP- exclusive vs inclusive fostering considerations for placement

KP- criticism of British Children Bill
SU- Foster Children; Foster Parents; Social Casework
AB- Argues that more types of children are now being assessed as requiring fostering at a time when social service departments are finding it difficult to expand their number of foster homes. This greater demand for foster homes coincides with recent studies which help to clarify the nature of fostering. Accordingly, a distinction can be made between "exclusive" and "inclusive" fosterings. It is pointed out that a conflict exists between popularity of exclusive fostering and research findings which stress the value of inclusive fostering. Research is also identifying the contribution which social workers can make in the fostering field. However, the desired inputs of training, low caseloads, and staff stability pose problems for social work management. The research findings discussed in the paper are used to argue that the forthcoming British Children Bill is not only based on false assumptions about the behavior of natural parents but will also promote exclusive rather than inclusive fosterings. It is also argued that child welfare policy should be seen in a larger context of social reform. (43 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Reviews pertinent historical problems leading to innovative approaches in the management of abusive families and discusses the development and experience of the child abuse project of Sinai Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland. The team takes the view that child abuse is a social ill, the roots of which often stem from an unhealthy environment within the family of the victim. The team is composed of 2 full-time community aides, a half-time nurse, a consulting pediatrician, a consulting psychiatrist, and a full-time social worker. During the past 2 yrs, the team has served more than 30 families. Case illustrations are cited. A goal for each family is the definition and clarification of problems that can be dealt with in the family's future contacts with team members.

KP- previous work experience

KP- social work graduate students
SU- Anxiety; Graduate Students; Self Concept; Social Work Education; Social Workers
AB- Examined the impact of previous work experience on the manifest anxiety level and self-concept of 49 US graduate social work students. Data were gathered using the Taylor Manifest Anxiety scale and the Tennessee Self Concept Scale. Contrary to the hypothesis, prior work experience did not act as an inhibitor of anxiety nor as a support to self-concept. No significant difference on test scores was found between Ss with work experience and those with no work experience. Manifest anxiety levels and self-concept scores of Ss in either category were not different from those found in other occupational populations. It is tentatively suggested that social work students may not have higher anxiety levels as some of the literature has indicated. It may be that the anxiety social work educators see in students in the field is quite within normal limits, that it does not threaten students' self-concepts, and that it does not inhibit learning.

AB- Reviews a range of formulations about the Chicano family drawn from the literature. Attention is given to the conceptions of ideal family models used as criteria for studying Chicanos. It is suggested that a re-examination of ideal family forms may benefit from the Chicano family experience. The main strength of the Chicano family is in its stress on human relationships and its sense of community, which to a great extent are not emphasized within the larger American structure. To develop an appreciative viewpoint from which to view the Chicano family would appear to require a reappraisal of the values of the wider society.

AB- Reports on the work of a study group formed to develop more responsible, sensitive, and skillful caseworkers in the treatment of child-abuse cases. Some literature on child abuse is cited and excerpts from case histories presented. Maltreatment is considered to bear no relation to the child's behavior in many instances, but may relate to the parents' negative feelings about themselves or their situation. Resistance among caseworkers to treating abusive parents is discussed. Methods of developing a treatment relationship, defining precipitating factors, understanding rage, and helping parents modify behavior are discussed.

Appearing initially as part of a nightmare, the elephant is considered to represent the patient's anxiety related to aggression. The function of animal symbolism in primitive tribes, religion, and mythology is explored. The question is raised as to whether there exists a universal unconscious recognition of the meaning of certain symbols, such as the elephant.

AB- Presents case material to demonstrate the usefulness of R. M. Foster's approach to family intervention. Rationalizations often used by parents to explain their children's behavior are pointed out, as are the pseudodemands parents make on their children as a consequence of these rationalizations. Ways to therapeutically intervene are suggested. Emphasis is on changing behavior. Frequent past objections to Foster's technique made by professionals are discussed in an attempt to further clarify the technique. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

KP- milieu therapy program
KP- hospital stay & discharge & adjustment to community
KP- chronic patients in state hospital
SU- Hospital Discharge; Psychiatric Hospitalization; Psychiatric Patients; Psychosocial Readjustment; Therapeutic Community
AB- Conducted a milieu therapy program with 2 groups of chronic patients in a state hospital with the goals of shortening their stays, discharging them into the community, and helping them adjust to the community. In groups of 10-13, patients were encouraged to solve their own problems, rely less on attendants, and realistically expect discharge. Life was constructed in the hospital setting in a way that made "getting out" the central issue for all patients. Group I originated with 54 female patients who were classified by the attendant staff as the most recalcitrant to rehabilitation. When a patient was discharged from the group, she was immediately replaced with another chronic patient. During the first 16 mo, of 75 patients, 50 were discharged to convalescent leave, 11 to family care, 3 were directly discharged, and 11 were transferred to another building. In Group II, with 58 younger female patients, results were similar. It is concluded that milieu therapy holds substantial promise for overcoming social disabilities commonly associated with mental illness. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

KP- classical psychoanalytic theory of feminine psychology
KP- client-therapist relationship in psychotherapy & therapist's sex role bias
SU- Human Females; Psychoanalytic Theory; Psychotherapeutic Processes; Stereotyped Attitudes; Womens Liberation Movement
AB- Presents the theories of feminine psychology as found in the paradigms of Freudianism, neo-Freudianism, and learning theory, and sets forth the implications of such ideology for the client-therapist relationship. The classical psychoanalytic theory is seen as viewing woman's condition as passive and receptive, as ordained by her anatomy which naturally develops passive tendencies in social roles. The male is seen as dominant, endowed as he is with a penis. The female's psychologically normal role, as the anatomical receptor, is seen as that of wife and mother, dependent on the male, submissive. Male characteristics are positive, female characteristics negative. To help her overcome this negative self-image, often perpetuated by the therapist, therapy in a consciousness-raising group is recommended for the female client. Central to the ideology of such groups is the belief that the individual, the social structure, and the culture are interrelated. For the therapists-who often unconsiously impose classical attitudes on their clients-sensitivity training is suggested to help them evaluate and remedy personal sex-role bias.

AB- Reports the emotional reactions of staff members to abortion work, some factors that influenced these reactions, and whether intellectual attitudes toward abortion were related to emotional response. A self-administered questionnaire concerning personal characteristics, attitude toward abortion, and emotional reaction to abortion work was distributed to 66 doctors, nurses, and social workers at 2 eastern teaching hospitals. Response rate was 63.6%. This study found that negative emotional reactions or discomfort arising from personal involvement in abortion work correlated highly with profession, type of patient care given, and contact with the aborted fetus. Correlations existed (a) between negative reaction and religion, (b) between negative reaction and the ability to personally choose to do abortion work, (c) between discomfort with abortion work and abortion law preference, and (d) between discomfort and the method of abortion.

AB- Considers the possibility that soap operas, watched by 35-40 million women, may be an example of myth and a route to the collective unconscious. Myths are catalytic in the continual reworking of internal conflicts and identities. An individual can actually assume only a given number of roles at any 1 time, but through imagination and role-playing he may try on persona from all stages of life. Soap operas are described as helping the individual to try on his multiplicity of roles and rework his singular and group identities. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

Changes in public attitude and official policy and in the administration of the welfare system have seriously affected the services available. There has been a notable increase in cases closed by the New York City Department of Social Services as "ineligible." Because of senility, infirmity, mental illness, retardation, and the like, many elderly clients are incapable of completing the required forms and thus are unable to obtain assistance. Among the hundreds of young people who come to the attention of the Society, problems of mental illness, addiction, unwanted pregnancies, unemployment, family conflicts, and loneliness reflect a time of social flux.

There is the imminent possibility of court cases to test the legality of the present policies. It is suggested that adoption agencies must begin to re-evaluate their position in regard to sealed records. The present standards of anonymity were developed as a safeguard for all those people involved in adoption; however, a study is described which indicates that for many persons these standards have been the cause of insoluble problems. It is concluded that the role of the agency as intermediary among adoptee, natural parents, and adoptive parents should be considered in a new creative way.

AB- Contends that psychoanalytic theory is not sufficient for establishing guidelines for child placement. The issues of continuity and multiple parenting are tested against available empirical evidence. It is suggested that legal recommendations drawn from psychoanalytic theory may warrant re-evaluation, and that the best interests of the child are not deducible from theory.

SU- Antisocial Behavior; Mental Health Program Evaluation
AB- Evaluated the extent to which program planning affects the behavior of antisocial children, with 8-16 yr old anti- and prosocial boys as Ss. 8 categories of activities were measured-verbal activity, "it" games, team sports, free swimming, arts and crafts, special events, transitional activity, and written tasks. Those activities that tended to decrease antisocial and nonsocial behavior and those that tended to increase the incidence of prosocial behavior are described. Results show that program planning is a pertinent variable in controlling the behavior of antisocial children. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Reviews the literature and current approaches to treatment of lesbians, and presents preliminary findings of a study based on a nonclinical sample of 51 Ss. The life-styles of the Ss, their problems, views of themselves, relationships with others, and their perceptions of society's reactions to them are explored. Findings indicate that lesbians all too often find the helping professions, as well as a number of American institutions, to be judgmental and nonsupportive of them. This is attributed, at least in part, to the dearth of practical and theoretical literature concerning the female homosexual. (24 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

KP- social worker & client perspectives of meetings
KP- outcomes of social work treatment
SU- Psychotherapeutic Processes; Social Casework
AB- Describes how social worker and client perspectives on various aspects of their meetings are related to one or all of several outcomes of treatment (e.g., failure to give a service, failure to perceive the social worker's role, or the failure to continue to seek help). The author's experiences with 8 sets of clients are described to illustrate how the outcome in each case is a reflection of each party's interpretations of crucial aspects of the meetings. Although this may reflect a 1-sided picture of the practice of social work, it is argued that it also emphasizes the process in which past and present circumstances affect both parties' perspectives of the therapeutic contact and how these circumstances increase the probability that the clients will either fail to obtain help or regard their meetings with social workers as no different from other passing contacts with "officials" who feature in their lives.

KP- parental childrearing methods
KP- inoperability of middle-class child-centered behavior applications & family cohesiveness to delinquency prevention in milieu of poverty
SU- Childrearing Practices; Juvenile Delinquency; Poverty; Poverty Areas; Social Values
AB- Considers that middle-class child-centered behavior, as defined by J. Newson and E. Newson, is not operable in the milieu of poverty. Recent studies completed in England are cited which show that material shortages in the home and poor environmental conditions greatly affect parental child-rearing methods. An alternative model of child-centeredness applicable to the culture of poverty is proposed, and a group of families who share a relatively happy home atmosphere and enjoy participating in children's activities is identified, although it is pointed out that this type of family does not always prevent delinquency. Effective methods of delinquency prevention are shown not to be related to family cohesiveness. It is suggested that the current controversy over preparations for parenthood should acknowledge the realities of slum life which force parents to use child-rearing methods they in fact do not approve of. A more appropriate population for education in parenthood would be a socially upwardly mobile one. It is concluded that parents and children in the slums need vast financial resources to improve their conditions before an attempt is made to change their attitudes.

SU- Fear; Parent Child Relations; War
AB- Suggests, on the basis of recent war experiences in Israel, that parental fear reactions are especially traumatic for the small child when the parents try to protect him by denying the facts of war. Illustrations are cited which show that small children react to unexplained and hidden stress in their environment with distress. Children notice and can be helped to comprehend events that affect their lives. When an adult is able to act as mediator and interpreter of stressful events, the child's anxiety lessens and both adult and child find a new source of comfort and strength in each other.

AB- Views role enactment as a basic concept of intervention theory, encompassing all the verbal aspects of any therapy system. Environmental manipulation, behavior modification, moral exhortation, cognitive techniques, suggestion and autosuggestion, and ways in which these techniques relate to role enactment are discussed. Whether the self selects a role, or the role forms the self, role enactment produces changes in perception, opinion, and behavior. The extent to which these changes are temporary or long lasting has not yet been determined. Nevertheless, empirical evidence supports the conclusion that role enactment is a means of producing changes in behavior. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Investigated the treatment of parents in group psychotherapy at a child guidance clinic as seen by the parents and the group therapists. The 2 major schools of thought regarding the approach to parents' groups are contrasted; one emphasizes ego-oriented guidance, the other stresses the development of insight leading to deeper personality change. Parents and therapists evaluated treatment differently as to the importance of the group as family analogy and as to what constituted therapeutic gain. The study points to the need for more effective communication between group leaders and group members. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

KP- identification of dangerous juveniles & prediction of recidivism among assaultive boys
KP- usefulness of psychiatric evaluations & psychiatric diagnoses & recommendations based on ego functioning categories
SU- Attack Behavior; Juvenile Delinquency; Psychiatry; Psychodiagnosis; Recidivism
AB- Conducted a follow-up study of the usefulness of psychiatric evaluations and of how psychiatric diagnoses and recommendations, based upon categories of ego functioning, had predicted recidivism among 88 "assaultive boys" in the year after the evaluations. Major findings were that psychiatric evaluations did not appear to be useful in identifying dangerous juveniles or in predicting recidivism. Nonclinical variables were also examined and appeared to be better predictors of assaultive behaviors. Findings point to the need for a psychosocial approach in prediction and treatment.

Future needs in these areas that can be served by social workers are discussed. (34 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Discusses theory and relationships in casework with the terminally ill. Individuals are often left alone to face death. Professionals must involve themselves in this final crisis. Kubler-Ross has defined the stages of dying as denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. A case history illustrating the process is presented. Catastrophic illness is regarded as an important social concern demanding new approaches in management. The interdisciplinary team is suggested as one type of management.

SU- Social Casework; Vasectomy
AB- Discusses medical, psychological, and social aspects of vasectomy. The medical procedure is relatively simple but a later reversal is difficult. Psychological aspects are important both in motivation and aftereffects. Vasectomy does not seem to be useful in treating frigidity, impotence, or premature ejaculation. Infidelity, divorce, and separation are likewise unaffected by the operation. Men do not appear pressured into the procedure. Public attitudes have steadily become more accepting of this birth-control method, but professionals now caution against its unadvised use. Implications for social workers include program planning and development, education, and pre- and postcounseling. Professionally prepared workers are important in providing quality services.

Studies using this social systems approach (i.e., in which the family is regarded as the basic unit for treatment) are evaluated. Data suggest that (a) rehabilitation workers who viewed alcoholism as an illness did not have as great a success in working with alcoholic patients as did workers who held interaction orientations and (b) group counseling may be more effective than individual counseling in decreasing drinking. The need for further study of this explicit interactional approach toward alcoholism is emphasized, and the limitations of individualistic and illness-oriented models of alcoholism are noted.

The role of the therapist is an active one, establishing a relationship of trust on a mildly indulgent basis. The multifaceted approach uses techniques of relationship, nurture, mobilization, and limited clarification in reaching goals of ego-conservation or restoration. Hostility, denial, and transference are frequent elements in the long and often painful relationship, challenging the skills and understanding of the therapist; his acceptance of the alcoholic as treatable is essential for success.

A 3-fold treatment design included aversive stimuli to decrease the reinforcing properties of alcohol; family and group therapy to teach more adaptive behavior patterns; and changing the alcoholic's environment to increase satisfactions from life. After discharge, outpatient visits utilize similar techniques for as long as a year, and appear to be essential to sustained treatment gains. Treatment methods undergo constant evaluation, and a 2-yr period is projected as necessary to validate the approach. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

KP- citizen participation development
KP- Yugoslavia
KP- implications for community mental health centers in US
SU- Community Involvement; Community Mental Health Centers; Participation; Social Processes
AB- Describes the Yugoslavian experience in developing citizen participation and discusses its implications for community mental health centers in the US. The entire social, political, and economic system of Yugoslavia is built on the principle of citizen participation at all levels and self-management of decentralized communes. In the 1950's social welfare programs were separated from public administration and replaced with a single political authority with a team of mental health professionals, educators, and lawyers. The republic law sets program standards (e.g., professional qualifications), but citizens at the local level determine the programs they want to be implemented. The role of the professional is to advise, motivate, and stimulate the citizens, but not to formulate policy. It is suggested that at the inception, US community mental health centers should have applied some of these principles, particularly those of community involvement, professional advisors, and programs which reflect the diversity of the nation's catchment areas rather than the uniform definition of service by professionals. The Yugoslavian experience suggests that the thrust for self-identity and recognition by various ethnic groups in the US could be effectively met through meaningful citizen participation in decentralized social service organizations.

SU- Clients; Experimental Design; Sex Roles; Social Workers
AB- Surveyed articles published for the past 8 yrs in Social Work to determine the way in which authors treated the sex-role factor when studying social workers and their clients. Analysis shows that the issue is largely ignored; the sex of the therapist is rarely mentioned. It is argued that knowledge of the sex of the worker affects research outcome, particularly with special client groups (e.g., delinquents) where sex-role identification is a major issue. The relationships between sex and race of therapist and client are discussed. It is concluded that social workers would understand themselves and their clients better if research on the importance of race, ethnicity, and class were integrated with the effects of sex.

AB- Studied a university counseling center for women to determine better their needs and the types of services that would help them. Data on clinical status, demographic variables, and services used are reported for 46 clients. Case histories of 18 clients exhibiting moderate to severe depression during the initial interview are presented. It was found that most conflicts centered around career development and employment, enforced mobility caused by frequent relocation of the husband's job, and emotional conflicts over traditional vs nontraditional sex roles. Most clients showed an alleviation in symptoms within 4 mo. A 4-mo follow-up of the depressed client subgroup indicated general clinical improvement and greater social adjustment, as measured by effective participation in work or school. It is concluded that female high school students should be counseled concerning the advantages of combining roles and making long-term career plans.

AB- Conducted a study at a state hospital to determine the quantitative influence that counselors have on problems related to alcohol and drugs. Patients admitted from 7 counties which employed full-time drug and alcohol counselors (N = 6) were compared with patients from 10 counties without counselors. Counselors were mostly ex-alcoholic paraprofessionals. The counselors were found to have a significant impact. Counseled patients had higher admission rates, shorter length of stay in the hospital, longer length of time back in the community, and lower rates of readmission.

SU- Behavior Modification; Clinical Methods Training; Lower Class; Middle Class; Parents
AB- Describes a training program designed to help parents modify problem behaviors in their 10-mo-old to 6-yr-old children. 29 welfare and 29 middle-class families participated in welfare only, middle-class only, or mixed groups. The major tasks of the parents were to read assignments on behavior modification techniques, monitor their child's behaviors weekly, apply change procedures, and develop treatment plans independently. Parents chose the behaviors they wished to modify. The most frequent treatment procedure used by parents was primary reinforcement coupled with enthusiastic praise. Weekly group meetings were held to prepare for home assignments and provide feedback concerning the accomplishments of the past week. It was found that while outcome was successful for the majority of participants, the greatest success was obtained in the mixed group. The major difference between the 2 class groups as a whole was that it took the welfare parents longer to develop adequate monitoring and treatment plans. Class differences in the target behaviors selected were also observed. It is concluded that welfare parents who are grouped with middle-class parents are more motivated to child behavioral change, and that welfare mothers can successfully utilize behavior modification procedures with their children.

Aims were to offer in-home rehabilitation, counseling, and guidance service to families with problems in child-rearing; to train adult paraprofessionals as parent-aides in family living and child-rearing with expertise in working with families within their home settings; to test the feasibility of group meetings for sharing problems; and to offer an alternative to hospitalization. 17 families were served. Aides spent 65% of their time in direct contact with 20% devoted to telephone contacts. Parents reported marked differences in their living situations as a result of the help provided by the parent-aides. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

After baseline data on the kind and frequency of maladaptive or disruptive behaviors were obtained, Ss were given in-hospital work and a list of the progressive steps through which they could obtain discharge. Staff cooperation was elicited through the use of behavior therapy seminars which outlined program goals and implementation. Results indicate a reduction in specific disruptive behavior. It is suggested that the outcome was successful because the consequences of inappropriate behaviors were clearly specified and consistently applied, appropriate behavior was reinforced, and patients had less unstructured time that might encourage maladaptive behavior.

AB- Studied the occurrence of nonverbal courting behaviors between patient and therapist as similarly found in American courtship (a concept advanced by Scheflen as quasi-courting). A series of interviews from a convenience sample were observed and instances of quasi-courting noted. 26 interviews in an adult clinic showed no instances of the behavior. 21 of 36 interviews in an aftercare unit did show occurrences. Therapists using quasi-courting were unexpectedly found familiar with it as a therapeutic technique. It is concluded that the behavior occurs with differential frequency related to settings and individuals. Possible uses and misuses are noted.

AB- Discusses elements of seductive behavior and difficulties in management, especially for learners. A review of the literature shows that while casework psychotherapy does not promote transference as does analysis, it more often deals with transference-prone clients. Therapeutic management of seductive behavior becomes a sensitive and difficult task. Given a questionnaire, the author's classmates narratively described an encounter. Almost 1/2 of 28 responses mentioned feelings of anxiety; 10 noted annoyance or anger; 22 contained some degree of diagnostic appraisal. Management efforts ranged from ignoring through confrontation, depending on the type of behavior and student worker. Seductive behavior is concluded to occur often, possibly causing discomfort as a threat to the professional role. Analytic understanding dissipates discomfort and supports professional effectiveness.

SU- Family Relations; Lead Poisoning; Recidivism
AB- To study the importance of family dynamics and social environment on lead poisoning in children, hospital records of 10 single-ingestor cases and 10 recidivist lead poisoning cases were compared. No significant differences were found in demographic data; both groups had socioeconomic characteristics associated with poverty. In terms of family diagnoses, single-ingestor families tended to be inadequate whereas recidivist families were unsocial and exhibited more severe pathology. Most families were below normal on all areas of family functioning (e.g., marital relationships and child-rearing practices). In all of the unsocial families and in 4 of the inadequate families the child continued to ingest foreign substances. Inadequate families followed directions for their child's treatment more than recidivist families, who exhibited aggressive resistance to treatment. It is concluded that family type is a significant variable in both the onset and recidivism of lead poisoning, and that family and social therapy is as important as medical procedures in treating the disease.

SU- Human Sex Differences; Psychiatric Patients; Psychiatrists; Psychologists; Social Workers
AB- Studied effects of patient's sex on the clinical judgment of 67 social workers, psychologists, and psychiatrists. Clinicians were asked to make judgments about 1 of 2 randomly distributed forms of a pretested case analog where every variable except the sex of the patient was held constant. Impressions were collected on a structured questionnaire. Group means were computed and descriptively small but statistically significant differences were found. The female patient was more frequently judged as healthier and despite agreement that passivity was the major problem, it was less often seen as the treatment focus for the male. Therapists anticipated more interfering countertransference would exist with the male. An unexpected finding was that social workers more frequently recommended supportive treatment for the female and interpretive, insight-oriented treatment for the male. Evidence of a double standard of mental health was observed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Presents the 2nd of 2 reports of content analysis of 138 hrs of taped conferences. It explains how relationship messages were defined and gives findings pertaining to relationship negotiations, including associations between congruence or incongruence of field instructor-student messages and independent indicators of relationship functioning. Covert relationship messages occurred in supervisory conferences. Incongruence was associated with relationship strain. In sample pairs which achieved accommodation in spite of disagreements in role stance at the outset, both parties compromised. Smooth relationships were likely for pairs which were matched in role stance. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

SU- Professional Ethics
AB- An examination of the codes of ethics of 89 human service occupational groups indicates that ethical principles can be classified into 4 categories reflecting the practitioner's personal characteristics and his relationships with clients, professional colleagues, and society. The codes stress that the practitioner should exhibit competence, impartiality, and integrity. In terms of relationships with clients, the practitioner should show objectivity, honesty, devotion, and confidentiality. Ethical principles among professional colleagues relate to etiquette, fairness, and maintenance of professional orientation. On the societal level, practitioners should take care in the use of personal status and should be concerned about social problems and the overall welfare of society. An evaluation of the Code of Ethics of the National Association of Social Workers indicates that it provides only a small portion of these ethical principles and lacks a clear system of implementation and enforcement.

KP- attitude towards self during adulthood stage of 25-35 yrs
KP- psychiatric residents & child fellows & social workers
SU- Developmental Stages; Psychiatric Training; Self Perception; Social Workers
AB- Studied ages 25-35 as a phase of adulthood. 30 psychiatric residents, child fellows, and social workers were asked how it felt to be their specific age. If appropriate, each was asked how it had felt at 25 and how it might feel at 35. Summaries were grouped by age and a content analysis was performed. Other analyses were done by regrouping of marital status, sex of S, parental status, and discipline. 4 features emerged from this time span: (a) descriptions of self changed; (b) respondents noted pressure to reach closure on personal issues within a limited time; (c) shifts in self-descriptions could be grouped in 3 related stages resulting from aging and its interactional effects with marriage, parenthood, career; and (d) 31-35 yr olds and others who were parents described themselves in terms consonant with E. Erikson's concept of generativity vs stagnation. Early adulthood is concluded to be a distinct phase. Tasks and new capacities are outlined.

KP- US
SU- Political Economic Systems; Racism; Social Processes
AB- Discusses operating policies in the US which serve to oppress individuals or groups through sanctioning inequality in status, access to goods and services, and different priorities for blacks and whites. It is argued that this institutional racism is deeply rooted in the social, economic, and political systems and that such racism may be covert (e.g., when college administrators use IQ tests as admission criteria). Institutional racism is considered to be particularly evident in the housing industry, e.g., when the federal government decided to subsidize a white exodus into suburbia rather than rebuild the cities and then allowed counties to pass ordinances prohibiting low income housing outside the cities. It is suggested that to combat institutional racism, blacks must be significant participants in decision-making regarding matters relating to the welfare of blacks and that programs should be developed which increase the power base and prestige of blacks.

AB- Describes the use of methods derived from social learning theory and some techniques of behavior modification as treatment for child abusers. The program was located in a predominantly black neighborhood and was staffed primarily by 4 female black family health workers, 3 full-time social workers, and a black registered nurse. The program encompasses 5 basic steps: (a) identify the cause of injury; (b) conduct a precise behavioral analysis of the parent's child management techniques; (c) decide whether the child can be returned to the family if the program provides continued assistance; (d) formulate plans for treatment; and (e) introduce the family to the staff, usually when the child leaves the hospital. Treatment involves using specific procedures for certain problem areas in parent-child relationships, establishing a continuity of service between the child's hospitalization and the parent's treatment, and evaluating behavioral changes. Problems and limitations of the program are briefly noted. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

At a follow-up of 3 mo none of the other patients had improved. At a 1-yr follow-up 1 "anxious" patient had entered the significantly improved category with additional help and 3 showed a trend toward improvement. Of the patients from "sick families" 1 eventually showed a trend toward improvement. Possible associations between family adjustment and the agoraphobe's chances of recovery are discussed.

SU- Family Relations; Male Delinquency
AB- Compared the family circumstances of 222 nondelinquent 11-14 yr old boys from a random sample of working-class families with those of 246 boys of the same age in court for the first time. Two-thirds of the officially delinquent boys came from ordinary families, intact and without serious problems. However, they were significantly more likely than the nondelinquents to come from broken homes or unbroken (intact) homes with serious and persistent problems. The differences were not due to neighborhood or school factors, which appear to a considerable extent to operate independently of family factors. Few first court appearances were explained by boys reacting to serious family stress. Follow-up of the delinquents over 2 yrs showed that approximately 25% of the boys from ordinary families became persistent offenders and approximately 33% of those from difficult family circumstances reappeared. Findings are discussed in the light of other research and current social work practice. (51 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Developed a casework-based method of assessment to examine the family dynamics of 67 school-phobic children, 41 10-16 yr old boys and 26 10-15 yr old girls. There were significant differences between the family interaction of male and female school-phobic children. The relationships were dichotomized along gender lines, broadly oedipal in nature. Findings and methodological problems are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Assessed the psychologically disturbing effects of 1 wk of sensitivity training, using 2 measures of disturbance: the Neuroticism scale of the Eysenck Personality Inventory (EPI) and a behavior change questionnaire completed by the 30 participants and 70 friends and close family members. Ss showed increased neuroticism on the EPI as a result of training, but this was not confirmed by Ss' family and friends 2 wks later (the most likely period of disturbance from training). Many trainees saw themselves and were seen by family and friends as slightly better able to cope with personal and family problems, better able to communicate and to get along with children and significant persons, and happier. Possible reasons for different results from the 2 measures are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Suggests that despite good intentions and special projects, education is critically affected by lack of knowledge and appreciation of different cultural patterns. Most reparatory approaches developed by schools to deal with problems of Puerto Rican children turn out to be unsystematic and fragmentary. Little is done to help these forces converge in positive ways. It is suggested that the problems of the city and its community are not being handled. Changes require more than a blend of competent staff, nonfragmentary planning, and benevolent purposes; they require organizing in areas about which information is still unformed.

The Puerto Rican family is, in contrast to the American, an extended family; intimate relationships with the kinship system are of high value and a source of pride and security. Relationships are intense and frequent, even if the persons are not living in the same household. In this patriarchal family, roles are clearly defined and strictly monitored. The elderly are respected and the young are dearly loved. The Puerto Rican family, however, encompasses not only those related by blood and marriage, but also those tied to it through custom.

KP- behavior modification as alternative to psychoanalytic treatment
SU- Behavior Modification; Psychoanalysis
AB- Uses a case report to (a) point out the strengths of behavior modification techniques as a tool in helping clients, and (b) stimulate practitioners into thinking of alternative techniques when traditional methods have failed to produce desired results. Use of a time-out procedure with positive and negative reinforcements produced improved behavior in a 7-yr-old boy. It is suggested that failure to respond to therapy is often seen solely in terms of resistance on the part of clients rather than as the result of the inappropriateness and ineffectiveness of the therapeutic intervention. Behavior modification is only one new tool to be considered as an alternative to traditional psychoanalytic treatment. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

SU- Human Services; Social Work Education
AB- Describes various solutions that administrators find practical in the training of mature, caring women to use their life experiences in human services. One year's full-time training which includes academic and fieldwork learning is felt to be sufficient. An evaluation of the program during its 2nd yr has shown it to be highly successful from the perspectives of both students and employers. Graduates do not compete with holders of the MSW degree but fill positions that would otherwise be held either by untrained personnel or college graduates. Employers recognize the impressive strengths that result from a combination of maturity and skill training. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- What is the effect of the milieu as distinguished from individual psychotherapy in the total treatment of emotionally disturbed or delinquent children? The cases of 3 boys who were residents at the Hawthorne Cedar Knolls School are presented. Generalizing from these and other similar cases it is suggested that the therapeutic environment alone may accomplish the task where (1) the task is one of ego development rather than the correction of fairly crystalized personality problems, and (2) in those rare instances in which the child's personality disorder is a reaction response to placement at a fairly young age.

AB- The case of a 21-year-old man, severly handicapped from birth by spaciticity due to cerebral palsy, is used to indicate that an effective rehabilitative program demands a "total push" effort and that such an effort requires close and purposeful collaboration of multidiscipline personnel in both the intramural settling and in the community. The rehabilitative program extending over a period of 4 years shows the vital need for coordination of team activities and the fact that the specific leadership of the team may change over a period of time; in the case presented, from the medical personnel to the psychological personnel and then to the patient himself.

Instead of regarding the beginning phase of casework as chiefly a study or exploratory phase, it is advocted that its purpose should be "to engage the applicant in working to use the help the agency can offer him… to help an 'applicant' to undertake the role of 'client."' Suggestions are made as to how this may be done. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- The psychosocial aspects of hemophilia are not as well understood as the medical problems it presents. Parents of hemophilic infants are confronted with the problem of giving their child physical protection without making him overdependent. The adolescent hemophilic may call into question his own adequacy in relation to most of the important adjustment indices in the adult world. Female relatives experience conflict arising from the fact that while they are not affected by the illness they may be carriers of the defective gene. "Self-help" groups are discussed as a valuable means of rendering therapeutic help to hemophiliacs and their families. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Areport of the work of the Intensive Treatment Unit at San Quentin which is testing the general hypothesis that prison inmates who receive intensive casework services will make a better parole adjustment than will those who do not receive such treatment. The report is of impressions and observations rather than statistical findings. Cases are cited which show that the problems of the men include emotional dependency, feelings of inadequacy, basic lack of trust, psychosexual conflicts, authority problems, schizoid patterns, and antisocial identifications. The examples cited suggest that the criminals' actions which may look "brave" and "bold" are a cloak to hide a sense of inadequacy. Basic casework principles of treatment appear applicable to this group of clients. "There is evidence that a helping relationship can be established with prisoners but it is too early to report on the effectiveness of casework treatment in modifying these severe psychological disorders."

KP- THERAPY FOR
KP- CHARACTERISTICS OF
KP- CRIME & DELINQUENCY
AB- A particular kind of casework treatment is required for delinquents because of their unique character structure. 2 factors are seen as characterizing the delinquent: persistence of instinctual drives and lack of sufficient internalized control of these drives. The author answers his own question of "why does a child become a delinquent instead of a neurotic?" by suggesting that the delinquent "externalizes his disturbance instead of internalizing his problem and developing symptoms." The treatment approach advocated is based on the assumption that the basic emotional defect of the delinquent derives from the parent-child relationship and involves "environmental change in terms of the delinquent's relationship to his therapist."

Differences in the 2 areas with respect to the casework process and its problems and limitations are discussed and illustrated. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- The authors contend that when a child experiences rejection a vicious cycle is generated in the parent-child relationship. "The child becomes anxious and insecure about whether or not his parents really love him. He then tests them, retaliates, rebels, or withdraws. The parents in turn, feel unappreciated and rejected, and their negative, hostile, and rejecting feelings are further stirred up, aggravated and intensified." Clinical experience is cited and the implications for casework with parents is discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- The article contends that it is essential for a social worker, dealing with a functioning human being, to recognize that psychiatric and social science explanations complement each other and that both are necessary. To illustrate his contention, the author cites the unusual piece of behavior known as "windigo psychosis," found among the Algonkian-speaking Indians of northeastern Canada. To fully understand this phenomenon one must consider it both psychiatrically and culturally. Each approach to understanding complements the other; each is essential.

Toward this end, the utility of family sessions of the type conducted by Nathan W. Ackerman are described and appraised. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

The purpose of the project was to study the effects of an enriched school curriculum on children who live in an isolated deprived community. Hopefully it would help to alleviate a situation in which there is marked and steady deterioration in the performance and behavior of the school children when they reach the 5th grade. A program characterized as "preventive casework" utilizing the "positive approach" was instituted. The development and execution of the program is described and illustrated. Preliminary impressions suggest that it is resulting in improved school performance and more positive interpersonal relations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- "World order may bear down upon and remold our family life into new focus, but so also, to some small degree, in reciprocal action, changes in family life may alter human destiny in the world arena." In developing this thesis the author first discusses selected insights about family life from the anthropologists, psychoanalysts, and social psychologists, and later, others deriving from the individualized approach to family dynamics.

AB- Poorer women engage in community activities much less frequently than their middle-class peers. This survey found the probable reasons to be in the following differences between the 2 classes: poorer women have less time (more children and less help), middle-class women have been exposed more to community activities in their upbringing, the morale of poorer women was lower, and poorer women were more concerned with bread and butter economics than emotional and social welfare.

The child's prelogical thinking presents an additional obstacle. To involve the child, the therapist should become active, but this very activity will make it difficult for the therapist to revert to the passivity recommended by classical Freudians.

KP- TREATMENT METHODS
AB- Interviews of mothers who had been referred to other agencies after initial consultations at the clinic revealed that slightly more than half of the mothers accepted the referrals. A greater percentage of those who accepted the referrals, than the referral-rejecting mothers, reported improvement. The caseworker surmised that many of the referral-rejecting mothers reported improvement as means of denying their error in not following the recommendation. A higher percentage of those who accepted the referrals expressed positive feelings towards the clinic than those who did not follow the recommendation.

Cases illustrate the use of homemakers as substitutes for ill or deceased mothers; in the home where a mother, though mentally ill, is still living in the home; in the home where mothers, though reasonably normal, are overwhelmed by burdens; in assisting elderly persons. The decision to use a homemaker should be based on a sociopsychological diagnosis and may be constructively implemented by psychiatric consultation. Emphasis is upon maintenance of mental health and prevention of mental illness. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

The casework process is described in terms of these topics: patient-worker relationship, exploring the patient's problems, encouraging verbalization, holding the patient to reality, dealing with anger and paranoid ideas.

Because of this change in emphasis, the caseworker must face new kinds of problems arising out of his relationship to his client. This in turn means that the supervisor must become more aware of her functions: providing certain emotional supports for the worker, perceiving the worker's difficulties, understanding the worker's self-image.

AB- Described in this paper are some of the possible reasons for discrepancies between the way the client evaluates the effectiveness of his counseling and how an agency review of the case record evaluates it: (a) Semantic differences between the way the client and agency define a problem. As problems were made more specific, client and agency agreed more on the nature of the problem. (b) Agency records can differ enough from one counselor to another so that extent of agreement between reviewer and client may be significantly reduced. (c) Client movement scores may be more sensitive to differences in the absolute level of adjustment than reviewer movement scores are. (d) The use of the movement scores to measure change does not appear to be an accurate way of predicting individual client change in the setting described in this study.

Just as the demanding child may threaten to hurt himself if his parents do not give in to him, so the adult patient may react to the doctor or social worker and similarly test him. The author believes that this reaction is a factor in provoking irregular discharges from sanitoriums, and describes how the social worker in handling the patient's "ultimatum" can help reduce this source of discharge.

The article concludes with a discussion of the implications of the preceding data for agency policies and practice. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

Among the tentative conclusions which a search of this literature offers are: emotional disorders and mental illness are affected by cultural conditions; in helping the client who belongs to a different ethnic group, an awareness of the cultural implications of communication is important; religious and family values tend to play important roles in mental illness.

Kris concludes that social isolation is the social factor which most patients have to overcome to achieve adequate posthospital adjustment. Hitchman feels that most patient made average posthospital adjustment, although he recognizes that the drugs repress, but do not cure, symptoms. Jockel exhorts caseworkers to work to rehabilitate such patients. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

In cases involving inner emotional problems, the most important factor in continuance in therapy was the attitude towards continuance of the patient's close relatives and friends. Those with external problems were least likely to continue in therapy. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- This report is based on a study of social work interviews with men whose wives, pregnant for the first time, were participating in a special "Family Health Clinic" program. "The major aims of the study were to find out: How men whose wives were pregnant for the first time were reacting to their new status as prospective fathers; what problems they saw as most pressing in relation to the new situation; the extent of their participation in the care of the baby; the caseworker's use of the interviews with the husbands and the influence of these contacts on the treatment plans." Findings indicate an apparently strong capacity in men for responding to the birth of their children. Continued study is indicated. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

The social worker in a children's residential treatment program has an important role in: (1) influencing the natural community; (2) in the foster home program with specific responsibility for homefinding and study; (3) and as part of the therapeutic milieu. Social work's major contribution should lie in the prevention area—in a "reaching out" casework which gets into family situations and provides help before breakdown is reached.

Further consideration needs to be given the possibility of engaging both partners in a treatment plan. When the less troubled partner cannot be involved, however, the realization of the importance of the partner will alert us to all possible clues. Basic professional skills must be used in uncovering and appraising the forces impinging on and interacting with the client's needs and drives.

These findings are based on observations made after the 1948 Family Service Survey. Cases terminating with only one interview seem to consist of at least three kinds of clients: (1) those for whom service is completed within one interview, (2) those directed elsewhere for service, and (3) those who seem to need casework but break off contact.

Such a setting offers a challenge to young graduates of social work schools who subsequently enter military service.

Limit-setting is one of the major rehabilitative tools, rather than the goal, of correctional practice. Many of the child's basic feelings toward his parents, and therefore toward authority, can be worked through in the relationship with the probation officer who may also serve as an ego-ideal for him. Research is needed to explore further and to test out in practice the principles presented in this paper." (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

If caseworkers know some of the common characteristics of people who have character disorders, the range of individual variations and the appropriate application of treatment guides, they will be able to give more skilled service to the large segment of their clients which fall into the category of "character disorders."

AB- 2 groups of diagnostic signs are posited as additional to those delineated by Kanner, Mahler and Bender in infantile psychosis. These signs include a failure to play or to have a distinct form of play and characteristic learning responses and "retreat from learned skills." 5 symptom areas are reviewed in the make-up of the ego-retarded child: orientation to people, orientation to reality, play, use of the body and speech. In addition 3 collateral signs are discussed: vegetative disturbances, domestication and rate of physical development. A "quantitative topological investigation based upon a systematic method of inquiry and recording" is offered as a substitute for functional history-taking. This method is believed to be useful in differential diagnosis and to secure significant insights. 2 detailed examples are cited. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

Social work diagnosis and treatment of delinquents have stressed the former source although it accounts for only a part of public correctional case loads. Analysis is made of the social structure of a high school showing that the values held in highest esteem by faculty are achievable only by a few students. Organized defiance of the adult value system may result in the formation of delinquent sub-cultural groups. "Creative invention" of opportunities is needed to reintegrate the delinquent into society.

The group therapy program of the Council Child Development Center in New York City is presented. Problems encountered in the treatment process included the limited production of fantasy, repressed or preconscious material and a lack of "sharp transference phenomena." Treatment was directed to characterological problems rather than the resolution of symptoms. Aims were "modification of defenses to change attitudes and to free ego functions for more constructive experience." A case report is elaborated in detail. In general the group process proved effective in creating movement where little was anticipated. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Aplea is made for identification and specification of ego-strengths in the client to achieve a more adequate diagnosis and treatment of his problems. Three "primary factors" in treatability are posited: the client's volition, his capacity and his opportunities. Criteria for identifying the first two factors are elaborated. They include the individual's "willingness" to use help, this capacity to relate to others, bearing the frustration of postponing gratification and working through his problem, accepting his own "feelings" and the use of "social intelligence." Treatability also depends on the client's willingness and adaptability in meeting new problems. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

KP- TREATMENT METHODS
AB- Resistance to help is seen as "inherent in the nature of human conflict" when no new or tested solutions to old problems are available. The role of the medical social worker in overcoming resistances is explored. Casework seeks "to help the perturbed patient use his energy in his own behalf, toward stabilized health and functioning up to his optimum capacity." Resistance may be based on feeling that treatment is too severe for the return benefit or that it threatens to restore the individual to function in a life with which he cannot cope. A threatened patient is more likely to resist, thus requiring casework intervention. Resistance, however, since it indicates a desire to survive is an aid to therapy if redirected to "promote the patient's efforts at self-preservation." A three-step casework program to help achieve this goal is outlined. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

After a brief description of the history of the program, a re-evaluation of the individual casework approach is offered. A project developed in 1954 using five skilled professional service staff persons and a researcher to evaluate and help re-develop the program of the institution. The results of the group process employed both with the project staff and with the residents of the school are described. The program helped develop new methods of orientation, treatment, staff procedures and classification of boys for group placement. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- With a decreasing work week, an examination of leisure relative to work, class and family problems is needed. Work has come to be a central value in industrial civilization and society is unprepared for "the new leisure." Class differences are emerging in the meaning and use of leisure time. Work class attitudes reflect the wide acceptance of leisure and "work-saving" gadgets. Middle-class attitudes are more concerned with participation in community activities and some are "playing too hard at… trying to have productive and creative leisure." Family life is being fragmented by excessive participation. A community workshop organized to meet individual leisure needs is proposed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Therapeutic techniques which are effective with neurotic parents of delinquents do not appear to be appropriate for those parents who have "character disorders." Therapy with parents of this type is always a long term undertaking. The parent must go through 4 definite stages during treatment: (1) establishment of a strong relationship; (2) identification with the caseworker; (3) emotional separation from the caseworker; and (4) understanding his own behavior and origins. Various types of character disorders are described: oral, oral-erotic, oral-sadistic, anal, anal-erotic, and anal-sadistic. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

To a significantly greater extent the disability group had experienced during their first school years: a greater number of illnesses, accidents, and losses of loved ones through death and separation. Relatively few negative school experiences were reported by either group; therefore their problems are deemed not to emanate from school life.

Most said they had improved in the interim between initial consultation and the time the clinic called them for therapy. The length of the waiting period was not a factor in the failure of these people to accept therapy. Many thought they had been referred to another source.

AB- The author discusses the nature and process of casework diagnosis in its "truly creative and vital aspects." Diagnosis requires both knowledge and a disciplined method of thinking and begins with the making of observations—the question of "what" not "why." The focus must be on the person rather than the problem with attention to the accretion of evidence. The second step in the process of diagnosis requires a theoretical structure. "The danger is that theory may supplant rather than guide observations and that facts may be compelled to fit theory rather than theory be built to explain facts."

In addition, certain influences that contribute to increased social growth in children as well as greater family integration are suggested.

There are many cases where the student prefers to go to a college that is not connected with the school because school employed therapists are apt to be looked upon as parent substitutes.

Principles useful for parents in dealing more constructively with their children are identified. Three major factors responsible for the development of better understanding of family relationships on the part of the participants are discussed: (1) the influence of the group; (2) role of the group leader; and (3) choice of content for discussion.

Almost all had serious conduct disorders. An aspect of institutional casework is dealt with differing in goals and methods from the more usual residential therapy. "It is not directed primarily toward bringing about fundamental character changes; it is directed toward helping the child with his everyday problems of adjustment." The caseworker "utilizes the interview to help a client find a solution to an immediate and pressing conflict." The caseworker must call upon his highest faculties of diagnosis to deal with the immediate situation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

Experience with this type of casework has pointed up (1) the need for further knowledge and research, (2) our lack of workable problem classification in casework, (3) the complementary integration of the group work and casework method, (4) that family-centered casework constitutes further development of the psychiatric function of treating mental illness through treatment of the family, and (5) that family-centered casework is an indication of the maturation of social work.

AB- Three types of problems appeared: (1) where there was a connection between the problem and mobility but mobility per se was not the substantial cause of the problem; (2) where a crisis or special need could not be met adequately because of the distance between the family and relatives; and (3) where mobility did not cause the problem but was a striking feature of the problem. Adjustments are made because "(1) mobile families feel a strong sense of group unity; (2) families able to move and still to continue to be healthy and well adjusted have learned to 'settle in' in each place they live; and (3) escape or independence is an adequate device in meeting the needs of some families."

Two categories of casework treatment are discussed: (1) treatment aimed at maintaining adaptive patterns, and (2) treatment aimed at modifying adaptive patterns.

AB- Through case presentation, the author discusses special aspects of "family-oriented" treatment of marital problems in a family agency. It is concluded that (1) casework treatment of marital problems must be based on sound diagnosis which includes a psycho-social understanding of two partners as individuals and of the interactive relationship between them which functions as a "third force"; (2) treatment, whenever possible, should be made available to both partners in the reciprocal relationship of marriage; (3) in casework with marital problems the arena for treatment of each individual is the adaptive functioning of the ego.

He attempts to demonstrate the validity of the point of view which holds that the treatment of the older person and his place in the family affects significantly the welfare and social orientation of subsequent generations. Some of the outstanding factors that relate to problems of aging are discussed in terms of (1) sociological forces, (2) emotional forces to which the older person is exposed, (3) the effect on other members of the family.

Another (negative) group assumed the counselor had no sympathy or understanding, and they answered the same questions. It was concluded that an adolescent expects a helpful counselor to focus his attention on the relation—he would be: (1) eager to continue the relation, (2) willing to involve himself in the counselee's problems, (3) sensitive to therapy developments, (4) able to understand the adolescent's striving for independence, and (5) able to set reasonable limits in the therapeutic setting.

AB- Adolescents are most apt to seek help with problems related to school and vocational planning. They are least inclined to seek help for more personal problems regarding adjustments with the other sex and family relations. The person they would go to for help differed with the kind of problem considered. Adolescents do not like to be considered different in a maladjusted way. This often is the reason why they do not seek help. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

Data collected support the following conclusions: (1) counselors and similar professional workers vary in their attitude toward the use of such technical research aids as the Marriage Council schedules; (2) the more workers use these schedules the more favorable become their attitudes toward their use; (3) initial attitude toward use seemed to grow directly out of counselor's professional orientation; (4) when counselors can see the "harmlessness" of the schedules to the client, they tend to become more accepting of their use; (5) "atmosphere" in a given agency with regard to the integration of evaluative procedures also is related to counselors' change of attitude toward the schedules.

AB- 20 cases from a child guidance clinic were examined. In most cases the child-patient was rejected, and when there were other siblings, he had been singled out for rejection. The rejection preceded identification by the parent of the child-patient with a psychotic relative. The identification was a rationalization to cloak the mother's hostility and a method the mother used to relieve herself of responsibility for her son's behavior. The child-patient was singled out for rejection because he touched off problems troubling the mother. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

Contrary to expectations, the number of referrals from (1) the poor, (2) slum areas, and (3) areas nearest the clinic were not disproportionately high. Those from privileged areas were more prone to receive treatment while the others were more likely not to continue in treatment after initial interviews. The wealthier were more apt to have been referred by private professionals rather than by social agencies. The symptoms of the wealthier were of a withdrawal nature to greater extent than was the case among those of moderate or poor means. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

The natural mothers were more overtly hostile, probably because they felt secure enough to express their true feelings. The adopted children were more apt to display withdrawal symptoms, while the others were likely to display acting out symptoms. In other comparisons, no appreciable differences between the groups was noted. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- A group of mothers of well adjusted children was compared with mothers of clinic children. The difference was one of degree, rather than of kind. The mothers of the adjusted children were not all-loving and all-patient; nor were they free of problems and tensions. It was the intensity of the mother's conflicts and anxieties, as well as the intensity of the children's problems that distinguished the two groups. The mother of the disturbed child was typically more unhappy and discontent with hereself both as a person and as a mother. The poor mother-child relation was a symptom of deeper conflict in the mother. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

Answers were sought to these questions: (1) how many babies might the agency have placed earlier and with equally favorable results; (2) what misplacements may have been made; (3) should more weight have been given to knowledge of the child's background; (4) how did the child's development and psychological testing alter the placement potential. Conclusions point to placement as early an age as is consistent with the facts to be important for the development of healthy personality.

From these replies appropriate uses of the telephone in casework are formulated and discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

The following qualities marked the abnormal group and were absent in the normal one: (1) the mothers pushed their daughters to fit parental plans rather than allowing daughters to develop as free individuals, (2) the mother-daughter relationships were neurotically over-binding, (3) the mothers were not frank with their daughters but were ever presenting a front, (4) the relationships between parents were strained, and (5) the parents were anxiety ridden.

The author discusses the need for a more "assertive casework" to meet social responsibility to hard-to-reach parents, the defenses parents cling to when facing breakdown, the necessity to recognize and help with physical and socio-economic needs, difficulties in helping when the parents have severe emotional limitations, and demands placed on the worker.

AB- A description of the work of the Family Service of Philadelphia with children. A psychologist is used part time for testing; a psychiatrist supervises and teaches, although he is not a child psychiatrist. The main employees of the agency, social caseworkers, have been treating an increasingly wide range of children's emotional problems on all levels—from insight therapy to educational and environmental manipulation.

AB- Agencies would be helped by a technique that enables them to cull those most likely to profit from therapy. An experience table was developed for use in child guidance clinics after the intake interview. The table serves as a guidepost, listing the factors which have been found to be related to success or failure of therapy. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- The author cites the difficulty arising in treatment of a parent when his welfare tends to be of interest to the staff only as it has bearing on the welfare of the child. Only if parents are helped with own problems will therapy succeed in primary goal of helping the child. Help for himself becomes the dominant motive of the parent when his therapy passes beyond its earliest phase. Discussed to support these views are: (1) the parent's part in the diagnostic process; (2) aspects of planning therapy for parents; (3) objections of parent-centered focus; (4) why child-centered therapy may appear successful; (5) collaboration as a hindrance to parent's therapist; (6) problem children of successfully treated parents.

(3) Twice as many fee as non-fee cases were highly improved. (4) Negro clients improved more than others. (5) Up to a point, the greater the number of the interviews the greater the degree of improvement of the clients. 45 references. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

The inhibited tended to have parents who were overcontrolled, while the impulsive had parents who differed among themselves and were predominantly impulsive.

The administrator has three media for determining whether an applicant has these basic requirements: (1) past professional training and experience, (2) the personnel interview, and (3) the probationary period. The personnel interview is discussed in some detail. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

The study was focused on "the components of a satisfactory balance in the marriage." In slightly over half of the cases, one or both partners was given help in achieving increased self-understanding of his part in the marriage problems. Slightly less than half the cases were those where the primary difficulties stemmed from social pressures and where the casework treatment was directed towards helping the client improve his reality situation.

He sees as one of the chief obstacles to establishing an effective relationship between social worker and client the fact that "the profession of social work itself constitutes a sub-culture," which makes for difficulties in diagnosis, arriving at a treatment plan and goal. The "social work culture" and the problems of adjustment it brings between worker and client are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

The schizophrenic group displayed to greater extent the following: temper outbursts, shyness, disinterest, seclusiveness, excessive daydreaming, sleep disturbances, fluctuations between extremes of behavior, poor social relations, malnourishment, frequent illnesses, and asthenic body build. They were more likely to have lived in slum areas, and they were more apt to have parents who were: mentally ill, rejecting, domineering, overprotective, full of conflicts, and cruel. There were more broken homes among the schizophrenics and the circumstances causing the break in the home were more emotionally disturbing.

AB- This is the second and concluding part of a discussion of stuttering (see 28: 1266). The author emphasizes that treatment of the stutterer must be based upon sound psychological insights and may take the form of "psychoanalysis, analytically oriented psychotherapy, and psychiatric plus casework therapy conducted by a therapeutic team." Such types of treatment as hypnosis, vocal and rhythmic exercises and various devices of distraction are not "therapies of choice" and only serve to strengthen the isolation of the symptom and the patient's resistance to treatment. The author enlarges upon the change in self-image: from organ to total organism; schizoid and masochistic defenses, special problems, and the treatment adaptation by the therapeutic team.

AB- The author maintains that the primary purpose of supervision—whether it be in an analytic training situation or between social work student and supervisor or social worker and supervisor—is essentially a didactic one, not a therapeutic one. She discusses this point in the light of an historical point of view, relating developments in supervision to the development of dynamic concepts in psychiatry, progressive education, and in the training and bringing up of children. She further discusses the emotional reactions of students in training, the nature of professional training in supervision, and the differences between the didactic and the therapeutic situation.

AB- Incidents of social workers' behavior were classified into the six qualities which social workers had agreed to be necessary for success in the field. When these incidents were presented to workers for rating, there was good agreement as to whether the behavior was good social work practice, but very marked disagreement as to what quality was indicated by the behavior. This, it was observed, may be due to the fact that personality is a whole and should not be compartmentalized into isolated bits. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

Some of the results of this analysis are at variance with those already published. The areas of agreement and disagreement are summarized.

AB- Records of 40 psychoneurotic veterans were studied to select the factors related to their continued disabilities. Those who had been in the service longest prior to their disabilities had the best adjusted pre-service case histories. While this group remained generally better adjusted than the others in the post-service period, it failed to reach its old adjustment level by a wider margin than was the case for the others. It is concluded that those who underwent the most stress before succumbing to the war's stresses were left with the most psychological scars.

Recommendations for changes were submitted by the government to the administration and reports were received as to the hospital's reaction to the suggestions. The meetings enabled patients to express overtly their hostilities towards the hospital and to criticise both themselves and each other. The moods of the meetings varied, depending on the patient chairman who led the discussions. Most participants said the meetings were desirable but denied that they had been helped personally.

Fathers were more apt to bring adolescents and boys rather than younger children and girls. Fathers were more likely to be concerned with delinquent behavior of the children. Mothers were less cooperative when the cases were brought by the fathers. In both groups the father-child relationships were generally more healthy than the relationship of mother to child. The father-child relationship was generally warmer in those cases referred initially by the fathers. Reversal of parental roles was more common in the father-referred cases.

KP- TREATMENT METHODS
AB- Both verbal and nonverbal reassurance can be used to advantage in therapy. More skill is required for verbal reassurance and more damage is likely to result from its inept use; therefore it should be more sparingly used than non-verbal types. Silence, when the patient utters condemnatory remarks, and attitudes of acceptance and understanding are among the most effective forms of inexpressed reassurance. Statements relieving patients of their feelings of peculiarity, showing respect for and confidence in the patient, giving the patient responsibility for his own improvement, setting therapeutic limits and controls, and reminding the patient of his positive feelings—all serve as verbal reassurances when properly administered.

As a rule, those who had gained the most in therapy were the ones who continued to gain. Notable gains were noted after therapy and after the follow-up period in that the improved patients tended to (1) have better relations with girls of similar age (but not with boys), (2) have improved vocational adjustments, and (3) be less hostile towards their parents.

The authors discuss some of the reasons why research methods should be applied to an examination of practice in order to reach convincing conclusions about the nature, magnitude, and significance of the differences between the two disciplines.

Purpose of the psychiatric study and evaluation was to determine the applicant's need for institutional care and the institution's ability to provide such care. The authors conclude such psychiatric evaluation of applicants for admission about whom there is question is useful in the selection of people who will adapt well in the institutional setting.

In contrast to many of the primitive cultures, our society makes heavy demands upon the adolescent and at the same time fails to provide him with a preconceived and carefully outlined pattern to help him meet these demands. The social pressures upon the adolescent which result are discussed in terms of our society's emphasis upon self-development, the conflicting standards presented to children, limitations of school and free time activities, and variations in rate of maturation in different individuals.

AB- The "aggressive" approach as discussed in this paper is meant to convey "a greater going-out to the client in an effort to help him overcome the strong resistance he feels toward accepting service." The use of the work "preventive" implies an attempt "to arrest a damaging parent-child relationship before it becomes a full-blown emergency." The author believes the family casework agency has a community responsibility to depart from its sometimes too passive role and to move out more firmly to certain clients. Case illustrations are given. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

Skills discussed, with case illustrations, are those relating to helping the client (1) with a part of his problem, or (2) to bring out the real problem, or (3) to discuss the problems he is avoiding. Skills in use of resources, telephone, and recording are also discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

While the casework treatment had the particular focus of the medical setting, concurrent with the physical improvement was seen a change of direction in the emotional growth of the child.

AB- "The purpose of the study presented here is twofold: (1) investigation of the effect of an expanded scale on judgments of movement and (2) determination of whether social work students as well as experienced caseworkers can learn and use the Movement Scale." It is concluded that the general adoption of a 70-step scale of movement in place of the seven step scale is justified. The writers hesitated to conclude that social work students would be as competent as experienced caseworkers in using the scale since a few of the students in the study had had casework experience. More studies using student judges are indicated. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

Feeding problems occurred in 10 out of 14, and speech difficulties were found in 11 out of 12 of the schizophrenic children for whom data were available. None of the schizophrenic children had good relationships with other children. Too intense identification of mother with child and overprotection were common among the schizophrenics.

His life experiences reflect the worker's racial, economic, and religious background, as well as his social class status, his class allegiances, and habits of thought and behavior. These attitudes, goals, and needs interact with those of his client who is also materially influenced by the impact of his own culture. This interaction is not always recognized but may be active entirely at an unconscious level, disguised in rationalizations, theoretical assumptions and technical procedures. Unfamiliarity with the client's cultural group causes the worker to fall back on standards derived from his own culture. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

The problem of referral of the mother, child, or both, to a community resource should be based upon a diagnostic decision including casework, psychiatric and psychological evaluation. The need for continuing a casework contact after a lapse of a few months appears to be important. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- After discussing various psychological and social factors which lead to sexual promiscuity, the author focuses on the psychological and social difficulties of the young unmarried mother who comes to a social agency for help. Agencies are frequently unduly influenced by psychiatry. They show this tendency when they ascribe "deep abnormalities" to all unmarried mothers. A consistent application of this point of view crowds out the "practical help" that social case work offers, for "social case work is something in its own right, and not just a poor substitute for, an adjunct to, psychiatry."

AB- Unmarried motherhood in our culture represents an attempt to fulfill deep personality needs. The unmarried mother "should not be exposed to a fragmentary approach focused on the symptom of her personality disturbance." Illegitimate pregnancy frequently necessitates a client's use of a range of social services. Responsibility for diagnostic appraisal and formulation of treatment plans should be centered in one agency with access to specialized services when needed.

Valid reasons are seen for short contact cases and their increase in the past 5 years. Emphasis is placed upon the need for more careful diagnosis at time of intake. A need is seen for a more precise definition of terms among family agencies who want to examine short contact cases. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

This report of the process of psychiatric casework in the out-patient department of a United States army general hospital illustrates its similarity to the casework process in many civilian psychiatric settings. "The basic skill of casework is the same in all settings. Casework is applicable to the military community to the same degree that it applies to any well-organized community."

Limitations in the data perhaps contribute to making the study more important for further research than for practice. There was "confirmation of an hypothesis long held by caseworkers: What happens in the first interview is, more often than not, predictive of a client's desire for, and capacity to use, help."

A distinction is made between casework treatment and psychoanalytic treatment, with the preventive aspect of casework treatment being stressed. The question of whether family agencies should seek and accept appropriations from Mental Health Act funds is discussed and a suggested policy guide given for agencies expecting to do so. Emphasis is given to the need for greatly increased family-centered services of treatment and prevention in the community mental health program.

War affects children differently depending upon at least three aspects of a child's experience: (1) where the war is in relation to a child; (2) what war does to his family; (3) what kind of child he is. That the well-being of an infant is inextricably tied to the well-being of the mother is recognized in the suggestions given for war-time services to children. The effect of war on the school child and the adolescent is also discussed. Recognition is given to the responsibility of the federal government for developing war plans for children.

Pretreatment observation and analysis of records are valuable diagnostic and prognostic aids. The controlled setting should facilitate the distinction between "individual maladjustments in a normal family and normal individuals in a maladjusted family." The actual treatment process can be evaluated in terms of theoretically indicated, intended, and employed treatment methods. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- The early history of autistic children frequently contains evidence of severe feeding problems, massive startle reactions to mild stimuli, extreme passivity and other deviant characteristics which thwart the mother's psychobiological need to nurture successfully, rouse in her hostility and guilt, and interfere with the establishment of healthy mothering patterns. Her nonadaptive responses in turn reinforce the child's deviance. The concept of mutually deleterious mother-child transactions deliberately bypasses the theoretical controversy of organic or psychogenic etiology but supplies a basis for treatment of the mother. "The goal of casework [is] achieving an optimal interrelationship between the mother's personality structure and the child's special needs." Specific techniques are discussed.

SU- Clients; Group Counseling; Group Psychotherapy
AB- Family Service of Milwaukee undertook group counseling on an experimental basis to test the hypothesis that some clients would respond more readily to group counseling than to individual counseling. Since the hypothesis is supported by the evidence from this project, the agency hopes to expand its casework service to include group counseling and to learn more about the effectiveness and limitations of this technique. Because the maximum number of group meetings was limited to 30, the treatment goals for each member were modest. 3 of the women (Mrs. O, Mrs. M, and Mrs. L) expressed their satisfaction with the group and, by mutual agreement with the caseworker, terminated their contact with the agency. After 2 months, Mrs. S returned to the agency for individual counseling. Mrs. B moved away, but applied for treatment at a mental health clinic in her new location. In much of the professional literature, group counseling is proposed as an economy that enables one caseworker to treat more clients than he could treat in individual counseling. The results of this project do not support this assumption. On the contrary, for each group meeting, a minimum of 5 hours was spent in recording and planning, in formulating diagnoses, and in participating in psychiatric consultations. For some clients group counseling appears to be more effective than individual counseling in 2 specific areas: (a) securing diagnostic data and (b) penetrating the defenses of projection and denial. Group counseling is the treatment of choice when the client is tightly defended and is threatened in the 1-to-1 relationship. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Ego psychology can best be understood if viewed in historical perspective. In the early period of the development of psychoanalytic theory, a major interest was focused on libidinal drives and their intrapsychic vicissitudes. Beginning with Freud, leading theorists have believed that the psychoanalytic theoretical framework could become a general theory of human psychology. Recent developments in ego psychology contain many rich insights into the processes of adaptation. The major contributions of Hartmann and his collaborators and of Erikson have been described. The ego is now viewed as the central meeting ground of drives and their derivatives, the individual's sense of self and identity, and his sense of his relationship with the human and nonhuman environment around him. The study of ego psychology is necessary and useful for any person engaged in the arduous and complicated task—a task nonetheless infinitely rewarding—of working with people in their environments.

Conversely, while discomfort did not apepar sufficient to enable families to seek help, high discomfort appeared to have greater value as a predictor of follow-through." Follow-through was more strongly associated with continued discomfort than with having positive feelings towards the clinic. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Discusses the use of the chart pad and treatment contract in client-worker relations. The chart pad is a large board on which theoretical approaches to clients' problems can be illustrated without verbal communication. The contract defines treatment goals for the worker and client and sets a time limit on their accomplishment. These techniques place emphasis on the client as a coworker in the problem-solving process and result in treatment that is highly task-specific.
