Our interest is to conduct an historical review of social work research, capturing all the articles contained in “social work journals” among the databases served by ProQuest (with current UM subscriptions).  We performed a corresponding search with EbscoHost can export results as text documents in batches of 25,000 article records. We also performed a similar search with PubMed (public engine) which allows a record export of 100k.  ProQuest is by far the superior option, with coverage unmatched by the databases served by EbscoHost.  However, the export limit by ProQuest is 4,000 article records, and the ProQuest engines empties the search cache when the 4,000 article limit is reached.  Moreover, ProQuest does not have a “select all” function that would allow us to export in batches of 4,000 without scrolling through each page, selecting 100 articles on each page.
